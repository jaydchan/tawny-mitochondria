Mitochondria are made up of two membrane systems that
subdivide this organelle into two aqueous subcompartments:
the matrix, which is enclosed by the inner membrane, and the
intermembrane space, which is located between the inner and
the outer membrane. Protein import into mitochondria is a
complex reaction, as every protein has to be routed to its
specific destination within the organelle. In the past few years,
studies with mitochondria of Neurospora crassa and
Saccharomyces cerevisiae have led to the identification of four
distinct translocation machineries that are conserved among
eukaryotes. These translocases, in a concerted fashion,
mediate import and sorting of proteins into the mitochondrial
subcompartments.

Introduction
Eukaryotic cells are subdivided into different compart-
ments that play unique roles in growth and cellular
metabolism, and contain specific collections of enzymes
that catalyse requisite chemical reactions. Since nearly all
proteins are synthesised in the cytoplasm, complex pro-
tein targeting systems exist that deliver every single
polypeptide to its specific destination. Typically, these
targeting systems comprise three components. First, sig-
nals on the proteins to be sorted that address it to the
target compartment. Second, chaperoning factors that
ensure a loosely folded, transport-competent conforma-
tion and the accessibility of the signals. Third, membrane
localised translocation machineries that are composed of
two elements: receptors that specifically recognise the
pertinent polypeptides, and channels that promote pre-
protein insertion into or translocation across lipid
bilayers. These translocation machineries are not just
pore-forming structures but rather active devices that
have to mediate uni-directional translocation by coupling
transport to exergonic reactions such as ATP hydrolysis or
protein folding.
Here, we report on recent advances in the understanding
on the process of protein transport to mitochondria. For
more detailed reviews, see [1–3].
The main road: protein transport to the
mitochondrial matrix
Mitochondrial targeting signals 
Proteins destined to be imported into mitochondria (pre-
proteins) are typically synthesised as precursors carrying
amino-terminal extensions. These presequences are both
necessary and sufficient for mitochondrial targeting [4] and
usually are proteolytically removed following translocation
into the matrix. These ‘matrix-targeting signals’ (MTSs)
comprise some 20 to 60 amino acid residues that have the
potential to form amphiphilic α-helices with one hydropho-
bic and one positively charged face [5,6]. The extent of
helicity, hydrophobicity and positive charge varies signifi-
cantly among different presequences and may have to be
balanced in vivo to minimise nonspecific membrane bind-
ing [7]. Although MTSs are usually found at the amino
terminus of preproteins, other arrangements have been
described recently: the mitochondrial DNA-helicase Hmi1
has a cleavable carboxy-terminal MTS, which mediates
import in a reverse carboxy- to amino-terminal direction
[8
•
]. Alternatively, a segment of positively charged amino
acid residues located directly carboxy-terminal of a single
transmembrane domain can form a hairpin-like structure
that mimics a typical amphiphilic presequence and func-
tions as an internal MTS [9]. Depending on the position of
the MTS, preproteins are thought to enter mitochondria
either in a linear fashion (where the amino or the carboxyl
terminus can be first) or as a loop (where the internal MTS
kink would be first). A number of mitochondrial prepro-
teins are lacking MTS-like sequences and harbour largely
unidentified signals within their sequences.
During or following synthesis in the cytosol, mitochondrial
preproteins are bound by chaperones that maintain them in
a loosely folded translocation-competent conformation.
These chaperones include members of the Hsp70 family as
well as specific factors, such as the mitochondrial import
stimulating factor (MSF), that recognise mitochondrial pre-
sequences [10–12]. At the level of the mitochondrial surface,
preproteins are recognised by receptors that are part of the
TOM complex (for translocase of the outer membrane).
The translocase of the outer membrane: the TOM
complex
The TOM complex is a multisubunit translocation
machinery. It comprises an array of import receptors and a
protein-conducting channel. The receptors appear to
guide the preproteins to the channel by sequential interac-
tions with negatively charged binding sites of increasing
affinities [13,14
•
].

membranes of yeast have provided insights in the compo-
sition, structure and channel functions of the TOM
complex [15
••
,16
•
,17]. After isolation from Neurospora
mitochondria, a holo complex of about 490 kDa can be dis-
sociated into the receptors Tom20 and Tom70, and the
core complex (or ‘general insertion pore’) consisting of
Tom40, Tom22, Tom7 and Tom6. The four latter subunits
form a structure of 12 nm × 7 nm (diameter in the mem-
brane plane) × 7 nm (height). Two pores of about 2.1 nm
diameter are most likely to represent the protein-conduct-
ing channels. Tom40 is predicted to traverse the outer
membrane as a series of β strands [18]. It is the only essen-
tial TOM subunit in yeast and is most likely to be the main
element of the translocation pore [19
•
,20]. All other TOM
subunits are predicted to traverse the outer membrane by
helical transmembrane segments. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
deletion of Tom22 leads to subcomplexes comprising
Tom40, Tom7, Tom6, and Tom5 (for which no homologue
has been found so far in N. crassa). These subcomplexes
are still functional in protein import, although, in this case,
recruitment of preproteins to the translocation pore might
not be mediated by receptor components [20]. Thus,
Tom22 might form a link from the general insertion pore to
the receptor components Tom20 and Tom70. However,
the finding that newly imported Tom40 subunits can inte-
grate into pre-existing TOM complexes [21], and the
different crosslinking behaviour of Tom40 in the absence
and presence of preproteins [22] favours a more flexible
and dynamic architecture of the TOM complex.
Following translocation through the TOM channel, pre-
proteins bind to the intermembrane space-exposed face of
the complex presumably by specific interactions with
Tom40 [23] and/or Tom22 [14
•
,24]. How integral outer
membrane proteins leave the TOM complex and integrate
into the lipid bilayer is poorly understood.
The route into the mitochondrial matrix: the TIM23
complex
After translocation into the intermembrane space, prepro-
teins interact with the TIM23 complex. This translocase of
the inner membrane (TIM) consists of Tim17, Tim23,
Tim44 and presumably an as yet unidentified 14 kDa sub-
unit. The integral membrane proteins Tim23 and Tim17
are related in their sequence and form the protein-con-
ducting channel of the inner membrane [25,26]. The
hydrophilic matrix protein Tim44 is associated both with
Tim23/Tim17 [25,27] and with lipids of the inner mem-
brane [28]. These three subunits seem to be present in a
2:2:2 ratio but hardly anything is known on the structure of
the complex [29]. Tim23 of yeast forms dimers in the pres-
ence of a membrane potential [30]. Dimerisation is
mediated by leucine zippers in the amino-terminal domain
of Tim23. Binding of preproteins causes dissociation of the
Tim23 dimer and initiates translocation of the preprotein
across the inner membrane. In addition to dimerisation of
the TIM23 complex, the membrane potential may gener-
ate an electrophoretic driving force to translocate the
typically positively charged presequences into the matrix.
In the matrix, the incoming preprotein is bound by the
chaperone mt-Hsp70, which is associated with Tim44 in an
ATP-dependent manner. It has been suggested that
Tim44 is not an essential structural element of the translo-
cation pore, but is crucial for efficient interaction of the
incoming polypeptide with mt-Hsp70 [31]. Upon prepro-
tein binding to mt-Hsp70, ATP-hydrolysis occurs, leading
to a tight association of mt-Hsp70 to the preprotein and to
the dissociation of mt-Hsp70 from Tim44 [32]. The
nucleotide exchange factor Mge1 facilitates the release of
the nucleotide from mt-Hsp70 [33]. Two mt-Hsp70 mole-
cules are attached to the Tim44 dimer. This is proposed to
allow a ‘hand-over-hand’-like binding mode of mt-Hsp70
to the incoming polypeptide and to efficiently prevent the
backsliding of the preprotein [29]. 
The question how mt-Hsp70 generates the translocation
force for protein import has been addressed in several
studies, and two alternative models have been suggested.
mt-Hsp70 functions as a ratchet that transforms the bi-
directional movement of the preprotein resulting from
Brownian motion into an uni-directional translocation into
the matrix. According to the ‘Brownian ratchet hypothesis’
this mechanism is sufficient to import even folded proteins
into mitochondria. The increased ATP-requirement
observed for folded preproteins is thought to be due to the
need of a smaller step size of the ratchet under these con-
ditions [34]. Alternatively, a conformational change in the
mt-Hsp70 molecule has been proposed to generate a
power stroke that would pull the preprotein across the
inner membrane [35,36]. However, there is no direct evi-
dence for a pulling function of mt-Hsp70. As the
preproteins reach the mitochondrial matrix, mt-Hsp70 and
other chaperones mediate their folding and assembly (for
review see [2]). 
Different roads lead to the same destination:
protein sorting to the intermembrane space
and the inner membrane
Although the intermembrane space contains only few pro-
teins, several pathways into this subcompartment have
been described. Most intermembrane proteins do not con-
tain classic MTSs and require only the TOM complex to
reach the intermembrane space. However, some examples,
such as cytochrome b
2
, contain amino-terminal targeting
signals. Import of these proteins depends also on the
TIM23 complex. For detailed discussion see [37].
In the past few years, three different pathways have been
described that lead to a localisation of proteins in the inner
membrane. First, proteins can be imported as described
above for matrix proteins but become arrested at the level
of the TIM23 complex and are laterally inserted into the
lipid bilayer. This ‘stop-transfer mechanism’ [38,39] seems
to be typical for monotopic membrane proteins whose
amino terminus faces the matrix [40,41]. At least for one of
these proteins, D-lactate dehydrogenase, a cluster of
MC3201.QXD  03/23/2000  12:02  Page 211
charges located directly carboxy-terminal of the transmem-
brane segment is essential for translocation arrest and/or
membrane integration [41]. However, the process by
which preproteins leave the TIM23 channel and insert
into the membrane is poorly understood.
Secondly, proteins can be completely transported into the
matrix from where they reinsert into the inner membrane.
Thus, the domains of these proteins that are exposed in
the intermembrane space have to traverse the inner mem-
brane twice. This reinsertion process resembles the
membrane insertion of mitochondrially encoded proteins.
Signals and machinery mediating this process seem to be
conserved from the bacterial progenitors of mitochondria.
This route was therefore named the ‘conservative sorting’
pathway [42]. Examples include the mono- and polytopic
membrane proteins whose amino termini face the inter-
membrane space [41,43,44]. To date the inner membrane
protein Oxa1 is the only identified component of this
insertion complex. In addition, homologs of the general
protein translocation machinery of bacterial inner mem-
brane, the Sec complex (see review by Bernstein, this
issue, pp 203–209), seem to be present in mitochondria of
some primitive eukaryotes [45]. Oxa1 is conserved from
bacteria to chloroplasts and mitochondria, but only little is
known about the function and structure of this transloca-
tion machinery [46,47,48
••
]. As far as known no soluble
protein is exported across the inner membrane by the
Oxa1 complex. However, this translocase is able to facili-
tate the export of hydrophilic protein domains of
considerable length. In one example, even the fusion of
the 45 kDa protein Arg8 to the intermembrane space
domain of cytochrome oxidase subunit 2 led to an efficient
export of this 61 kDa sequence across the inner membrane
in an Oxa1-dependent manner [49]. Thus, the Oxa1
machinery is not simply an insertion facilitator for
hydrophobic segments but has the capacity to mediate the
penetration of long and hydrophilic polypeptides across
the inner membrane.
A third pathway into the inner membrane was discovered
only recently. This import route is used by polytopic mem-
brane proteins that do not contain classic MTSs but
internal targeting signals [50–52]. Members of the solute
carrier family such as the ATP/ADP carrier (AAC) belong to
this group. These proteins are recognised on the surface of
mitochondria by the Tom70 receptor before they are hand-
ed over to Tom20/Tom22 and the TOM channel. As the
precursors are partially translocated through the TOM
channel, they are pulled into the intermembrane space by
binding to a soluble 70 kDa complex composed of Tim9
and Tim10. Then they are transferred to the 300 kDa
TIM22 complex, which consists of the peripheral
Tim9/Tim10/Tim12 complex and the integral inner mem-
brane proteins Tim22 and Tim54 [53
••
,54–56,57
••
]. In the
presence of a membrane potential, the TIM22 complex
mediates the insertion of the preproteins into the inner
membrane [56]. Recently, a second soluble intermembrane
space complex formed by Tim8 and Tim13 was described
which also seems to be involved in mitochondrial protein
import. The exact function of Tim8 and Tim13, however, is
unknown [58,59]. Both soluble intermembrane space com-
plexes might play a chaperone-like function and prevent
misfolding and aggregation of hydrophobic inner
212 Cell regulation
Figure 1
The four translocation machineries identified
in mitochondria. The receptors, Tom70 and
Tom20, of the TOM complex recognise MTSs
on proteins targeted to the mitochondria and
guide the preproteins to the core complex
(Tom40, Tom22, Tom7, Tom6 and Tom5).
Once translocated into the innermembrane
space, the preproteins targeted for the matrix
interact with the TIM23 complex, causing the
dissociation of Tim23 dimer and translocation
of the preprotein across the inner membrane.
In the matrix, the prepeptide is bound by the
mt-Hsp70 chaperone which becomes
dissociated from Tim44. Preproteins can be
inserted into the inner membrane by several
different pathways. First, preprotein
translocation across the inner membrane
becomes arrested in the TIM23 complex and
the preprotein is inserted in the lipid bilayer.
Second, preproteins in the matrix can be
reinserted into the inner membrane by the
Oxa1 complex. Third, after translocation
through the TOM complex, a Tim9/Tim10
soluble complex binds preproteins and
transfers them to the TIM22 complex
(Tim9/Tim10/Tim12/Tim22/Tim54), which
mediates the insertion of the preproteins into
the inner membrane. E, Mge1.

membrane proteins as they cross the intermembrane space.
In addition, they might act as trapping devices that support
uni-directional protein translocation across the outer mem-
brane in a ratchet-like mechanism analogous to the role of
mt-Hsp70 for protein translocation into the matrix.
Conclusions
In summary, four protein translocation machineries have
been described in mitochondria: the TOM, the TIM23,
the TIM22 and the Oxa1 complexes (see Figure 1). They
mediate sorting and transport of preproteins into the mito-
chondrial subcompartments in a concerted action. There is
no evidence for a direct physical interaction of these com-
plexes. However, a functional and kinetic coupling is
likely for the translocation of preproteins across TOM and
TIM complexes since TIM subunits and mt-Hsp70 pro-
vide the energy for efficient preprotein translocation across
the TOM channel. In addition, it was reported recently
that import of the hydrophobic protein Coq2 is affected by
both Tim10 and Tim23 mutations and might therefore
require components of both TIM complexes [59].
Subunits of these translocation complexes do not show any
significant homology to prokaryotic proteins and obviously
originate after the uptake of mitochondrial ancestors by
eukaryotic host cells. In contrast, the Oxa1 translocase
appears to act independently of other translocases and rep-
resents a phylogenetically old translocation system that
mitochondria inherited from their prokaryotic progenitors.
Update
It has recently been shown that the E. coli homologue of
Oxa1 (now called YidC) cooperates with the Sec machinery
and is involved in insertion of hydrophobic proteins into
membranes [60].
