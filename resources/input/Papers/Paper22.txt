Abstract
Background: Zearalenone (ZEA) is a phytoestrogen from Fusarium species. The aims of the study was to identify
mode of human leukemic cell death induced by ZEA and the mechanisms involved.
Methods: Cell cytotoxicity of ZEA on human leukemic HL-60, U937 and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
was performed by using 3-(4,5-dimethyl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Reactive oxygen species
production, cell cycle analysis and mitochondrial transmembrane potential reduction was determined by employing
2’,7’-dichlorofluorescein diacetate, propidium iodide and 3,3’-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide and flow cytometry,
respectively. Caspase-3 and -8 activities were detected by using fluorogenic Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-
methylcoumarin (DEVD-AMC) and Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (IETD-AMC) substrates, respectively.
Protein expression of cytochrome c, Bax, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL was performed by Western blot. The expression of proteins
was assessed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel-electrophoresis (PAGE) coupled with LC-MS2 analysis and real-
time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) approach.
Results: ZEA was cytotoxic to U937 > HL-60 > PBMCs and caused subdiploid peaks and G1 arrest in both cell
lines. Apoptosis of human leukemic HL-60 and U937 cell apoptosis induced by ZEA was via an activation of
mitochondrial release of cytochrome c through mitochondrial transmembrane potential reduction, activation of
caspase-3 and -8, production of reactive oxygen species and induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress. Bax was up
regulated in a time-dependent manner and there was down regulation of Bcl-xL expression. Two-dimensional
PAGE coupled with LC-MS2 analysis showed that ZEA treatment of HL-60 cells produced differences in the levels
of 22 membrane proteins such as apoptosis inducing factor and the ER stress proteins including endoplasmic
reticulum protein 29 (ERp29), 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein, heat shock protein 90 and calreticulin, whereas
only ERp29 mRNA transcript increased.
Conclusion: ZEA induced human leukemic cell apoptosis via endoplasmic stress and mitochondrial pathway.
Introduction
The phytoestrogen zearalenone (ZEA) is one of the
most active naturally occurring estrogenic compounds
[1,2]. Food, snacks, dried fruits, dried vegetables and
beverages such as beer, often contain ZEA [3-5]. The
average daily intake of ZEA in adults ranges from 0.8-29
ng/kg body weight (b.w.)/day, while small children have
a higher average daily intake, 6-55 ng/kg b.w./day [6].
Treatment with Zea (10-40 μM) of Vero, Caco-2 and
DOK cells results in apoptosis as evidenced by DNA
ladder formation and presence of apoptotic bodies [7].
Recently, ZEA has been shown to induce apoptosis in
human hepatocytes (HepG2) via p53-dependent mito-
chondrial signaling pathway with the up regulation of
ATM and GADD45 involved in DNA repair [8].
In mammalian cells, there are two major pathways
involved in apoptosis: mitochondria-initiated intrinsic

pathway and death receptor-stimulated extrinsic path-
way [9-11]. In the former pathway, proapoptotic signals
provoke release from mitochondrial inter-membranous
space into cytosol of cytochrome c, which forms a com-
plex with Apaf-1 and dATP, known as apoptosome, and
triggers caspase-9 activation. Activation of caspase-9
leads to subsequent activation of executioner caspases,
such as caspase-3, -6, -7, which in turn stimulates a ser-
ies of apoptotic events, eventually leading to cell death
[9,12,13]. The extrinsic pathway begins with binding of
Fas ligand to Fas death receptor, and an adaptor mole-
cule is recruited to the receptor, which allows binding
and proteolytic activation of caspase-8. Activated cas-
pase-8 then cleaves effector caspase-3, -6 and -7, leading
to apoptotic cell death [10,12,14].
In addition to the above mentioned pathways, apopto-
sis can be induced via endoplasmic reticulum (ER),
which normally regulates protein synthesis and intracel-
lular calcium (Ca
2+
) homeostasis [15]. Excessive ER
stress triggers apoptosis through a variety of mechan-
isms including redox imbalance, alteration in Ca
2+
level
and activation of Bcl-2 family proteins [16].
Calreticulin (CRT) is an abundant Ca
2+
-binding cha-
perone, which is mostly present in ER lumen, although
it can also be found in other subcellular localizations
[17,18]. When present on the surface of damaged cells,
it can serve as an ‘eat-me’ signal and hence facilitates
the recognition and later engulfment of dying cells by
macrophages [19] or by dendritic cells [20]. It is thought
that this function determines the immunostimulatory
effect of CRT, as presentation of tumor antigens by den-
dritic cells is required for the immunogenic effect of
anthracyclin-treated cancer cells [20-22]. Alternatively,
CRT may bind tumor antigenic peptides and facilitate
their efficient presentation to T cells [23]. Crosstalk
with the two well-characterized apoptotic pathways also
exists, since ER stress can also activate caspase-8 and
caspase-9 [24,25].
The ability of ZEA to modulate leukemic cell growth
has not yet been well characterized. Using two human
leukemic HL-60 and U937 cell lines we found that
human leukemic cell apoptosis induced by ZEA was
related to caspase-3 and -8 activation, mitochondrial
transmembrane potential (MTP) reduction and cyto-
chrome c release. ZEA also induced oxidative stress via
ROS generation, Bax upregulation and Bcl-xL downre-
gulation. The mechanistic effect also involved increased
Ca
2+
concentration in cytosol and mitochondria indicat-
ing ER stress but there was no calreticulin exposure on
the cell surface at 30 min. Two-dimensional gel-electro-
phoresis of proteins following 24 h treatment revealed
upregulated expression of ER-mediated chaperone endo-
plasmic reticulum protein 29 (ERp29), 78 kDa glucose
regulated protein (GRP78), and calreticulin supporting
the involvement of ER stress.

streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37°C in a humidified atmo-
sphere containing 5% CO
2
. The human leukemic cells
(1 × 10
6
) were treated with ZEA at indicated concentra-
tion and duration. ZEA was dissolved in DMSO as a
vehicle and the maximal volume used was not exceeded
10 μl/ml of media.
The blood was obtained from adult volunteers with
IRB approval. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) were isolated from heparinized blood by den-
sity gradient centrifugation using lymphoprep according
to standard protocols. Cells were cultured in RPMI-
1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicil-
lin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. PBMCs (3 × 10
6
)were
treated with ZEA at indicated concentration and
duration.
Cytotoxicity test
Following ZEA treatment, cell viability was assessed by
MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide)
assay [26]. This method is based on the ability of viable
cells to reduce MTT and form a blue formazan product.
MTT solution (sterile stock solution of 5 mg/ml) was
added to cell suspension at a final concentration of
100 μg/ml and the solution incubated for 4 h at 37°C in a
humidified 5% CO
2
atmosphere. The medium was then
removed and cells were treated with DMSO for 30 min.
The optical density of the cell lysate was measured at
540 nm with reference wavelength of 630 nm using micro-
titer plate reader (Biotek, USA). Number of viable cells
was calculated from untreated cells, and the data were
expressed as percent cell viability.
Determination of mitochondrial transmembrane potential
and ROS production
For measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential
and intracellular ROS, either 40 nM 3,3’-dihexyloxacar-
bocyanine iodide (for mitochondrial transmembrane
potential determination) or 5 μM2’,7’-dichlorofluores-
cein diacetate (for ROS detection) were added for
15 min at 37°C and the cells are then subjected to flow
cytometry.
For flow cytometric assessment of DNA fragmentation
and cell cycle distribution, 1 × 10
6
cells were harvested
and re-suspended in a solution containing PI (50 μg/ml),
0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% sodium citrate in PBS. Cells
then were analyzed in a FACScan equipped with a
488 nm argon laser using CellQuest software (Becton-
Dickinson, USA). Data were depicted as histograms and
the percentage of cells displaying hypodiploid DNA con-
tent was indicated. Percentage of cells in each phase was
also evaluated to determine the existence of cell cycle
arrest.
Assay of caspase-3 and caspase-8 activity
Cleavage of the fluorogenic peptide substrates DEVD-
AMC and IETD-AMC, indicative of caspase-3-like and
caspase-8-like enzyme activity, was estimated. Cell lysates
(1 × 10
6
cells) and substrate (50 μM) were combined in a
standard reaction buffer and added to a 96-well plate.
Enzyme-catalyzed release of AMC was measured by a
fluorescence plate reader (Bio-tek, USA) using 355 nm
excitation and 460 nm emission wavelengths.
Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel-electrophoresis
(2-D PAGE)
U937 cells, treated and untreated with 20 μM ZEA for 4
and 24 h were harvested and washed twice and the cell
precipitates were used further. Albumin was first
removed using ProteoExtract Albumin/Removal kit. The
amount of protein loaded in 2-D PAGE was 200 μg/gel.
2-D PAGE was performed using the immobiline/polya-
crylamide system. Samples were applied by overnight in-
gel rehydration of 70 mm nonlinear pH 3-10 IPG gel
strips. The first dimension (IEF) was performed at 6500
Vh for 3.5 h, using a Pharmacia LKB Multiphor II sys-
tem. IPG strips were equilibrated with buffer in two
steps. The first step employed 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer,
pH 6.8, 6 M urea, 30% glycerol, 1% SDS, and 1% DTT,
while 2.5% iodoacetamide replaced DTT in the second
step. Then IPG strips were applied to the second-
dimension 12.5% T SDS polyacrylamide gels (100 mm ×
105 mm × 1.5 mm). Electrophoresis was performed in a
Hoefer system at 20 mA for 2.5 h at room temperature.
After electrophoresis, proteins were visualized by CBR-
250 staining.
PAGE of plasma membrane proteins
ProteoPrep Universal Protein Extraction kit was used to
isolate membrane and cytosolic proteins from HL-60
cell line. The cytoplasmic extraction reagent was added
to the cell pellet and the sample was sonicated at 4°C
and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 45 min. The superna-
tant was collected. The same reagent was added to the
remaining pellet, followed by sonication and centrifuga-
tion, and the resulting supernatant was pooled with that
obtained earlier. The pooled supernatant was dried
using Speed Vac. The dried sample was resuspended in
the soluble protein resuspension reagent (Sup1).
The precipitate was resuspended in cellular and orga-
nellemembranesolubilizingreagent.Thesamplewas
centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 45 min at 15°C. The super-
natant was collected as Sup2. Sup1 and 2 were treated
with 5 mM tributylphosphine (TBP) (reduction) for 1 h
at room temperature, then 15 mM iodoacetamide (alky-
lation) was added and the reaction mixture was incu-
bated for 1.5 h. The reaction was stopped by adding

TBP and incubated for 15 min. The sample was centri-
fuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature and
the clear supernatant was collected. The concentrations
of proteins in Sup1 and Sup2 were measured using the
Bradford method. Samples were prepared for 2-D PAGE
by adding ampholine and solubilizing reagent to adjust
the volume.
2-D PAGE was performed using the immobiline/poly-
acrylamide system. Samples were applied by overnight
in-gel rehydration of 70 mm nonlinear pH 3-10 IPG gel
strips. The first dimension electrophoresis (IEF) was
performed as described for U937 cells.
Tryptic in-gel digestion of protein spots
Differential expression of proteomic profiles in treated
and untreated cell lines were compared. Spots of interest
were excised and transferred to 1.5 ml tubes. A 50 μl
aliquot of 0.1 M NH
4
HCO
3
in 50% acetonitrile was
added, and the gel was incubated for 20 min at 30°C.
The solvent was discarded and the gel particles were
dried completely. Reduction and alkylation was per-
formed by swelling the gel pieces in 50 μl buffer solu-
tion (0.1 M NH
4
HCO
3
,10mMDTT,and1mM
EDTA) and incubating at 60°C for 45 min. Then the
excess liquid was removed and quickly replaced by the
same volume of freshly prepared 100 mM iodoaceta-
mide in 0.1 M NH
4
HCO
3
solution. The gel suspension
was incubated at room temperature in the dark for
30 min and iodoacetamide solution removed. Each gel
piece was washed with 50% acetonitrile in water 3 times
for 10 min, and completely dried. A 50 μl aliquot of
digestion buffer (0.05 M Tris HCl, 10% acetonitrile,
1mMCaCl
2
,pH8.5)and1μl aliquot of trypsin (1 mg
trypsinin10μl 1% acetic acid) were added to the gel
pieces. The mixtures were incubated at 37°C overnight.
The digestion buffer was removed and saved. The gel
pieces were then extracted by adding 60 μl of 2% freshly
prepared trifluoroacetic acid and incubating for 30 min
at 60°C. The extract and saved digestion buffer were
pooled and dried. Digested peptides were dissolved in
6 μl of 0.1% formic acid for MS/MS injection.
Protein identification by LC-MS/MS
LC-MS/MS analyses were carried out using a capillary
LC system (Waters, UK) coupled to a Q-TOF mass
spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) equipped
with a Z-spray ion-source working in the nanoelectros-
pray mode. Glu-fibrinopeptide was used to calibrate the
instrument in MS/MS mode. Tryptic peptides were con-
centrated and desalted on a 75 μm ID × 150 mm C18
PepMap column (LC Packings, Amsterdam, The Neth-
erlands). Eluent A and B was 0.1% formic acid in 97%
water, 3% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in 97% acet-
onitrile respectively. Six μl of sample were injected into
the nanoLC system, and separation was performed using
the following gradient: 0 min 7% eluent B, 35 min 50%
B, 45 min 80% B, 49 min 80% B, 50 min 7% B, 60 min
7% B. Database search was performed with ProteinLynx
screening SWISS-PROT and NCBI. For proteins that
were difficult to find, Mascot search tool available on
the Matrix Science site screening NCBInr was used.
Gel scanning and image analysis
Stained gels were scanned using an ImageScanner II (GE
Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) and ImageMaster™(GE
Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) was used for computer
analysis.
Flow cytometric analysis of cell surface calreticulin
HL-60 cells were plated in 24-well plates and incubated
for the indicated time. Cells were harvested, washed
twice with PBS and incubated for 30 min with primary
antibody, diluted in cold blocking buffer (2% FBS in
PBS), followed by washing and incubation for 30 min
with the FITC-conjugated monoclonal secondary anti-
body diluted 1:500 in blocking buffer. Each sample was
then analyzed by FACScan (Becton Dickinson, USA) to
identify cell surface calreticulin. Isotype matched IgG
antibodies were used as control, and the fluorescence
intensity of stained cells was gated on PI-negative cells.
Western blot analysis
To obtain a cytosolic-rich fraction, ZEA-treated cells
were harvested and washed once in ice cold PBS and
incubated at 4°C for 10 min with ice-cold cell lysis buf-
fer (250 mM sucrose, 70 mM KCl, 0.25% Triton X-100,
100 μM PMSF, 1 mM DTT in PBS with complete mini
protease inhibitor cocktail). The cell suspension was
centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant
was collected as the cytosolic-rich fraction. Protein con-
centration of the cytosolic-rich fraction was determined
by the Bradford method. Cytosolic proteins (50 μg) were
separated by 17% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitro-
cellulose membranes. After treating with 5% non-fat
milk in TBS containing 0.2% Tween-20 (blocking buf-
fer), membranes were incubated with mouse monoclonal
antibodies to cytochrome c, Bax and Bcl-2 and rabbit
polyclonal antibody to Bcl-xL. For detection, appropriate
horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated secondary
antibodies were used at 1:20,000 dilution. Protein bands
were visualized on X-ray film with SuperSignal West
Pico Chemiluminecent Substrate.
FACS analysis for cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca
2+
levels
Cytosolic Ca
2+
levels were determined using the fluores-
cence dye 1 μMFluo3-AMinFITCsetting.Mitochon-
drial Ca
2+
levels were determined using the fluorescent
dye 250 nM Rhod2-AM in PE setting. After treatment

with ZEA for 4 h, cells were incubated with fluorescent
dye for 15 min at 37°C, and washed with PBS containing
10 mM glucose and analyzed immediately by flow cyto-
metry. In each analysis, 10,000 events were recorded
and analyzed by FACScan (Becton Dickinson, USA).
RNA extraction and gene expression analysis
Real-time PCR was used to examine expression of endo-
plasmic reticulum stress genes, viz. calreticulin (CRT),
glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78) and endoplasmic
reticulum protein-29 (ERp29), in the human leukemic
cell culture. RNA was isolated from HL-60 cell culture
using RNA extraction kit following the manufacturer’s
protocol. Total RNA (1 μg) was converted to cDNA
using RevertAid™ First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit. For
determination of ER stress gene expression, SYBR Green
detection was used and the values were normalized
using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH). Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reac-
tion (PCR) was performed in a DNA Engine (ABi 7500)
using SYBR GREENER qPCR UNIVERSAL. Primers
sequences are as in Table 1. Relative expression levels
for each primer set were normalized to the expression
of GAPDH by the 2
-ΔCT
method [27].
Statistical analysis
Results were expressed as mean ± SEM (standard error of
mean). Statistical difference between control and treated
group was determined by the one-way ANOVA (Kruskal
Wallis analysis) at limit of p < 0.05 in triplicate of three
independent experiments. For comparison between two
groups, data were analyzed using Student’s t-test.
Results
Cell cytotoxicity with apoptotic induction
Cell viability was evaluated in HL-60, U937 and PBMCs
after incubation with ZEA for 24 h using MTT assay.
ZEA was toxic to U937 and HL-60 cells with IC
50
value
of 5.1 μg/ml and 44 μg/ml, respectively, but was less
toxictoPBMCs,(IC
50
value > 80 μg/ml) (Figure 2A).
However, low concentrations of ZEA (5-20 μg/ml) had a
proliferative effect on PBMCs. ZEA induced apoptotic
death of HL-60 cells as evidenced by the changes in cell
morphology (condensed nuclei and apoptotic bodies)
(data not shown) and presence of cells with subdiploid
DNA (Figure 2B). There was G1 arrest in HL-60 cells
treated with 50 μg/ml ZEA (Figure 2C) and in U937
cells with 16 μg/ml (Figure 2D).
Mitochondria involvement in ZEA-induced HL-60 and
U937 cell apoptosis
The reduction of mitochondrial transmembrane potential
(MTP) accompanied by release of cytochrome c into cyto-
sol is often associated with apoptosis [28]. Treatment with
ZEA resulted in an increase in percent cells with reduced
MTP (Figure 3A and 3B) and cytosolic cytochrome c in a
dose dependent manner in HL-60 (Figure 3C).
Expression of Bax, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in ZEA-treated
HL-60 cells
The mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathway involves
Bax, a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member, which induces
permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane
allowing release of cytochrome c [29-31]. Bax expression
in HL-60 cells was up regulated in time dependent man-
ner (Figure 4A). Expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 did
not change, whereas that of anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL was
down regulated time-dependently (Figure 4A and 4B).
ROS production of ZEA on human leukemic cells
Changes in MTP are considered to involve ROS pro-
duction [32]. The ability of ZEA to generate ROS was
investigated using a fluorescence sensitive probe
(dichlorofluorescein diacetate), which detects peroxide
radicals and various other active oxygen radicals
[33,34]. ROS was produced in ZEA-treated HL-60
(Figure 5) indicating that the cause of apoptotic cell
injury was via oxidative stress.
Effect of ZEA on activities of caspase-3 and -8 in HL-60
and U937 cells
To address the role of activation of caspase activities in
ZEA-induced HL-60 and U937 apoptosis, specific cas-
pase substrates were used, namely DEVD-AMC (cas-
pase-3 substrate) and IETD-AMC (caspase-8 substrate).
ZEA induced in a dose-dependent manner activation of
caspase-3 activity but not that of caspase-8 in HL-60
(Figure 6A) and U937 cells (Figure 6B).
Protein expression in ZEA-treated U937 and HL-60 cells
TheeffectsofZEAonproteinexpressioninU937and
HL-60 cells were explored by 2D-PAGE. In U937 cells

role in ER protein folding [35], was decreased (dot no.
2; 1.55 folded-decrease, Table 2). These results point to
the presence of ER stress in ZEA-treated leukemic cells.
ER stress gene expression at mRNA levels
The results of 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis led us to
examine the ER stress gene expression at mRNA levels of
three genes (GRP78, CRT and ERp29), which were
increased in 2-D PAGE (Table 2), employing real-time
RT-PCR. GRP78 mRNA had a tendency to be up regu-
lated in a time response manner whereas CRT mRNA was
down regulated in a time response pattern as shown in
Figure 8. However, ERp29 mRNA expression prominently
increased 3.8 folds compared to control (Figure 8), which
supported the rising amount of ERp29 protein in 2-D
(2.99 folds as in Table 2).
Cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca
2+
status in ZEA-treated
leukemic cells
Increases in cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca
2+
levels
have been found in ER stressed cells [36]. As indicated
above, apoptosis of leukemic cells induced by ZEA also
involved ER stress, Ca
2+
levels in both mitochondria and
cytosol were measured. FACS analysis histograms of
Fluo3-AM-stained (Figure 9A) and Rhod2-stained
(Figure 9B) HL-60 cells treated with 10 and 20 μg/ml
ZEA revealed increased Ca
2+
levels in both cytosolic and
mitochondrial compartments.
Effect of ZEA treatment on calreticulin exposure on
cell surface
Reduction of ER Ca
2+
level (ER stress) favors cell surface
exposure of calreticulin [37]. Exposure for 30 min of
HL-60 cells to ZEA (10, 20 and 50 μg/ml) did not pro-
duce an increase in the presence of calreticulin on the
cell surface as assessed by FACS (Figure 10).
Discussion
ZEA is a non-steroidal estrogenic mycotoxin produced
as a secondary metabolite by several fungi of the genus

Fusarium [38,39]. In the present study, ZEA induced
apoptosis in human leukemic HL-60 and U937 cell
lines, but less in PBMCs, as evidenced by presence of
apoptotic bodies and cells with subdiploid peaks (repre-
senting DNA fragmentation). ZEA is cytotoxic to bovine
lymphocytes [40] and induces human PBMC apoptosis
and necrosis depending on the concentrations of
ZEA [41].
Two central pathways have been shown to be involved
in the process of apoptotic cell death: one is the death
receptor pathway with direct involvement of caspase-8
and the other is the mitochondrial pathway in which
cytochrome c is released from mitochondria into cyto-
sol. Data presented here suggest that mitochondrial dys-
function is the mechanism involved in ZEA-induced
apoptotic death in human leukemic cells. ZEA targets
mitochondria and/or lysosomes and induces lipid perox-
idation (indicating oxidative stress) and cell death in
human colon Caco-2 cell line [42]. The loss of mito-
chondrial transmembrane potential and the increase of
ROS generation were early events caused by ZEA. The
following two possibilities are proposed: (i) ZEA
increases ROS production which leads to mitochondrial
dysfunction; (ii) Mitochondrial dysfunction is induced
by ZEA treatment and results in ROS generation.
Bax, a pro-apoptotic protein in Bcl-2 family, was upre-
gulated indicating the involvement of mitochondria, as
Bax forms channels at the outer mitochondrial mem-
brane to facilitate the release of cytochrome c [43,44].
Activation of mitochondrial permeability transition is
required for the complete release of cytochrome c
[45,46]. The increased ratios of Bax/Bcl-2 and Bax/Bcl-
xL in ZEA-treated human leukemic cells would facilitate
this process. It has been recently reported that ZEA-
induced human hepatoma HepG2 cell apoptosis also
involves mitochondrial alterations including Bax reloca-
lization into the mitochondrial outer membrane, loss of
mitochondrial transmembrane potential, permeability
transition pore complex opening, ROS production and
cytochrome c release [32].

Proteomic profiling of ZEA-treated and untreated
U937 cells revealed a role of enzymes in carbohydrate
and nucleotide metabolism in apoptosis. Besides its role
in glycolysis, GAPDH initiates a cell death cascade [47].
Diverse apoptotic stimuli activate inducible nitric oxide
synthase (iNOS) or neuronal NOS (nNOS), with the NO
S-nitrosylating GAPDH, abolishing its catalytic activity
and conferring on it the ability to bind to Siah1, an E3-
ubiquitin-ligase with a nuclear localizing signal. The
GAPDH-Siah1 protein complex, in turn, translocates to
the nucleus and mediates cell death.
The involvement of ER stress in ZEA-induced apopto-
sis shown in this study led to an investigation of CRT,
an ER-resident stress-regulated chaperone with C-term-
inal KDEL signal [48,49]. Under certain circumstances,
ER dysfunction leads to an accumulation of unfolded or
misfolded proteins in the ER lumen and activates com-
pensatory mechanism, which has been referred to as ER
stress response or unfolded protein response [50]. Sev-
eral ER transmembrane proteins are identified as sen-
sors of ER stress. These include pancreatic ER kinase
(PERK), inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) and activat-
ing transcription factor 6 (ATF6). PERK phosphorylates
the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2
(eIF2alpha), which attenuates the initiation of translation
in response to ER stress. The activation of IRE1 and
ATF6 signaling promotes pro-apoptotic transcription
factor CHOP and the expression of ER-localized
chaperones, such as CRT, GRP78 and GRP94, which
facilitate the restoration of proper protein folding within
the ER [50]. These protective responses result in an
overall decrease in translation, enhanced protein degra-
dation and increased levels of ER chaperones, which
consequently increase the protein folding capacity of the
ER. However, sustained ER stress ultimately leads to
decreased ER chaperone and cell death [50]. CRT was
translocated to the cell membrane of human leukemic
cells treated with ZEA (Figure 7B). ER also regulates cal-
cium ion homeostasis and Ca
2+
levels were increased in
cytosol and mitochondria, suggesting the involvement of
ER stress in ZEA-treated human leukemic cells. 2D-
PAGE of HL-60 treated cells showed increased expres-
sion of GRP78, ERp29 and CRT precursor confirming
the existence of ER stress. Real-time reverse transcrip-
tion PCR supported the involvement of ERp29 in the
human leukemic HL-60 cell apoptosis. For CRT and
GRP78 gene expression, the mRNA might not be stable
and was degraded at the measured-time. Nevertheless,
ER stress can also activate caspase-9 by releasing cyto-
chrome c from mitochondria to cytosol [24,25].
The accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER was
a marker of cellular stress induced by ZEA. Oxidative
stress was also found in ZEA-stimulated human leuke-
mic cell apoptosis (Figure 5). The involvement of ER
stress and oxidative stress in ZEA-induced apoptosis of
human leukemic cell lines are first described, however,
further experiments are required to demonstrate the sig-
naling relationship between the oxidative stress and ER
stress.
The contents of ZEA in the daily intake might
enhance the apoptotic effect of promyelocytic and
monocytic leukemic cell lines in the leukemic patients.
ZEA-induced apoptosis and necrosis occur in human
PBMCs in vitro depending on the concentrations of
ZEA [41]. The major metabolites of ZEA in various spe-
cies are alpha and beta zearalenol. Alpha and beta zeara-
lenol inhibit cell viability and induce oxidative stress and
stress protein (HSP70 and HSP27) expression in Vero
cells (kidney epithelial cells extracted from African
green monkey) [51]. However, more studies should be
performed in in vivo model before using ZEA as a ther-
apeutic drug.
Taken together, the intrinsic (mitochondrial) and ER
stress pathways cooperated in ZEA-induced human leu-
kemic cell apoptosis. An understanding of the mechan-
ism of ZEA-activated leukemic cell death is a basic step
in clinical therapeutic approaches.
