human mtDNA is characterized by a much greater
evolutionary rate than that of the average nuclear gene.
Thus, its sequence variation has been generated solely by
the sequential accumulation of new mutations along
radiating maternal lineages. The time frame of these
mutations is such that human mtDNA contains a
molecular record not only of the genealogical history but
also of the migrations of women who transmitted it
throughthegenerations.Becausetheprocessofmolecular
differentiation is relatively fast and occurred mainly
during and after the recent process of dispersal into
different parts of the world, subsets of mtDNA variation
usually tend to be restricted to particular geographic
levels of recurrent mutation, blurring the structure of the
tree – while there is insufficient variation to distinguish
many important ancient branches within the tree.
Consequently, the phylogeographic signal of mtDNA as
seen through the window of HVS-I variation can be
almost invisible. A combination of high-resolution RFLP
screening with HVS-I sequencing eventually resulted
in a much more refined picture of the mtDNA world
phylogeny – one in which the major branches of the
tree were usually restricted geographically, some to
sub-Saharan Africans, others to East Asians and yet
others to Europeans and Near Easterners [2].

Human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) studies have
entered a new phase since the blossoming of complete
genome analyses. Sequencing complete mtDNAs is
more expensive and more labour intensive than restric-
tion analysis or simply sequencing the control region of
the molecule. But the efforts are paying off, as the
phylogenetic resolution of the mtDNA tree has been
greatly improved, and, in turn, phylogeographic
interpretations can be given correspondingly greater
precision in terms of the timing and direction of human
dispersals. Therefore, despite mtDNA being only a
fraction of our total genome, the deciphering of its
evolution is profoundly changing our perception about
how modern humans spread across our planet. Here we
illustrate the phylogeographic approach with two case
studies: the initial dispersal out of Africa, and the
colonization of Europe.
Introduction
In human cells, most genes (w25 000) are confined to the
nucleus, limited to two copies per cell and transmitted
equally from both parents according to Mendel’s laws.
A major exception is represented by the 37 mitochondrial
DNA (mtDNA) genes. They are located within the
mitochondria, organized in a small (w16.6 Kb) circular
molecule of DNA, which is present in hundreds to
numbers of subjects, with the objective of determining
human origins in each major geographic area. These
studies were performed by using either RFLP survey of
the entire mtDNA molecule, thus mainly targeting the
coding region, or sequencing of the first hypervariable
of the human

the highest possible level of molecular resolution (i.e. that
of complete mtDNA sequences) are now enabling us to
determine where and when particular branching events
are likely to have occurred, as the first step in the
reconstruction of prehistoric human dispersals.
Human mtDNA variation
The earliest mitochondrial DNA research began by
digesting the entire molecule with just a few restriction
enzymes. As early as 1980, Brown’s pioneering study of 21
humans from diverse ethnic and geographic backgrounds
indicated that mtDNA restriction-enzyme fragment
length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns could be used to
trace human genetic history [1]. On the basis of the
observed diversity in a worldwide sample, he obtained a
surprisingly recent coalescence age estimate ofw180 000
years for global mtDNA variation.
During the early 1990s, in parallel with the studies
addressing the origin of Homo sapiens, mtDNA analyses
numbers of ancestral migrations from Asia [3]. It was in
thisspecific contextthatthe(bynow) universally accepted

mtDNA haplogroupnomenclature was initiated, withfour
basal (or primary) branches in the tree, named alphabe-
tically as A, B, C and D. (A haplogroup is a group of
mtDNA haplotypes derived by descent from the same
ancestral mtDNA molecule as revealed by the sharing of a
distinguishing mutational motif.) Later, the haplogroup
structures of other continental populations were charac-
terized [4,5] and cladistic rules for the hierarchical
ordering of haplogroups and sub-haplogroups were expli-
citly established [6]. The same principles were later used
as the basis of the reformed nomenclature for the Y
chromosomal tree[7].Thenamingofnewhaplogroups has
since then naturally developed in a self-organizing way,
ushered forward by those who produce novel data,
following the rules of the nomenclature system and
respecting the published record.
In the medical field, a team led by Ozawa had begun to
resolve the Japanese mtDNA tree based on complete
mtDNA sequencing [8–10], which eventually culminated
in the recent study of Tanaka et al. [11]. However, that
early work was almost unnoticed by the population
genetics community until recently [12,13] when complete
genome analyses started blossoming [14–16]. There are
now O2000 complete mtDNA sequences published, so
that the basal branching structure of mtDNA variation
in many – perhaps most – parts of the world is now well
understood. Details concerning specific branches of the
phylogeny, often restricted to microgeographic contexts,
are available from several recent studies [17–26].Asa
result, not only the Out-of-Africa debate but also the
controversy about the origins of Europeans has come into
sharper focus, so that opposing bold claims of the past can
givewaytomorerefinedmodellingandinsights,aswewill
outline next.
Archaeogenetics
Amorim [27] coined the elegant term ‘archaeogenetics’
for ‘the newly-emerged discipline that applies molecular
genetics to the study of the human past’ [28],thus
substituting the earlier term ‘historical genetics’ [29].
Archaeogenetics was prefigured in the work of Luca
Cavalli-Sforza and his colleagues, working on classical
genetic markers in the 1970s (see Ref. [30] for a personal
account;andRef.[31]forasummaryoftheclassicalwork).
Cavalli-Sforza’s work was the first major attempt to bring
archaeology and genetics together in a single discipline
and, perhaps most significantly, he did this by forging
collaborations with the archaeological community – an
achievementofwhichmanysubsequentresearchersinthe
field unfortunately failed to take note.
Cavalli-Sforza and his colleagues focused particularly
on the settlement of Europe, using the methodology of
synthetic genetic maps: geographic maps of isopleths of
principal components (PCs) values of variation. Although
ideally suitedto the kind ofdataavailable at thetime, this
approach could not provide a time frame for the different
components, so that the interpretation of the maps
remained ambiguous [28,32,33]. The map of the first PC,
accounting for w27% of the total variation in classical
marker frequencies across Europe and the Near East, has
become something of an icon in the study of European

origins. It showed a gradient from the southeast to the
northwest, with the Near East at one pole and Europe at
the other, which was originally seen as strong evidence for
the ‘demic diffusion’ hypothesis – implying that Neolithic
farmers coming from the Near East and autochthonous
Mesolithic European hunter-gatherers intermingled
progressively. We will return to this issue later, but first
we move to the other classic issue in archaeogenetics: the
exit out of Africa of anatomically modern humans.
Out of Africa
TravellingupthehumanmtDNAphylogenyfromtheroot,
corresponding to what has, often rather confusingly, been
identified with ‘mitochondrial Eve’ [34],onepasses
through several bi- and trifurcations until one reaches
the first multifurcation node, the root of haplogroup L3
(Figure 1). This root gave rise to many (successful)
descendant haplogroups, perhaps reflecting some coloni-
zation event or local population growth w80 000–90 000
years ago, which might have been triggered by the glacial
interstadial phase 21 [35,36] and, possibly, followed by
cultural adaptation in response to the changing climate.
This event probably occurred in the Horn of Africa
because the richest branching around the L3 node is
reflected in modern Ethiopian samples [37], in contrast to
the somewhat narrower mtDNA pools of other parts of
sub-Saharan Africa.
Two splinters of this basal L3 variation, haplogroups M
and N, cover the mtDNA pool of all non-Africans
(excluding the descendants of migrations from Africa
within the past few thousand years, such as those
engenderedbyvariousslavetrades).HaplogroupNalmost
immediately diverged further to give rise to haplogroup R
(Figure 2). All over Eurasia, America, Australasia and
Oceania descendants of all three corresponding root
haplotypes (M, N and R) can be found, with only a few
more impoverished regional exceptions. Therefore, these
three root types (which originated somewhere between
East Africa and the Persian Gulf) must have been the
founder types for the Eurasian settlement w60 000–
65 000 years ago [22,38]. Not only are the descendants of
these founders ubiquitous outside Africa but also their
numerous basal sub-branches are more or less specific to
the major geographical regions. There is now growing
evidence that the richest basal variation in the three
founder haplogroups M, N and R is found along the
southern stretch of Eurasia, particularly in the Indian
subcontinent [18,25]. Although Southeast Asia has been
less comprehensively analysed to date, recent first results
indicate a similarly high basal diversification in this
region [22]. This suggests a rapid colonization along the
southern coast ofAsia,reaching Sahulw60 000 yearsago.
The expansions northwards to fill the heartland of the
continent occurred later, w45 000 years ago, when
technology and climatic conditions enabled the explora-
tion of the interior of Eurasia. One of the more marginal
extensions eventually led to the peopling of Europe.
Into Europe

that all Europeans essentially share the same set of

logroupswereabsentfromsub-SaharanAfricansandEast
Asians [39].TheseobservationsconfirmedthatEuropeans
and Near Easterners share a rather recent common
ancestry. From the complete mtDNA phylogeny that is
nowavailable,wecanseethatEuropeanmtDNAvariation
–embeddedasitisintheWestEurasianmtDNAvariation
– is surprisingly impoverished in the number of indepen-
dent basal lineages, compared with the South Asian
mtDNA variation. Most European mtDNA lineages stem
from just three R branches, haplogroups R0 (previously
known as pre-HV), JTand U, in addition to three minor N
branches, N1, N2 and X (Figure 2). Some further West
Eurasian branches, such as R1 and R2 [18], seem to be
rare in Europe. This reduction in basal variation can be
best explained by the peripheral role that the pioneer
migration into the Near East and subsequently Europe
must have had in the broader ‘Out-of-Africa’ scenario
(in contrast to traditional accounts that gave the Near
East a pivotal role). The variation in the basal European
mtDNA haplogroups can be dated to w40 000–50 000
years, likely to be coincident with interstadial 12 [35,36].

Figure1. A maximum-likelihood phylogeny of African mtDNA haplogroups, with a calibrated time-scale (left). Sequencing of the 25 entire mtDNAs (1–25) was performed as in
[17,20,22]. To construct the phylogeny, we focused on the more slowly evolving coding region of the molecule between nucleotide positions (nps) 577 and 16023, using two
chimpanzee sequences to root the whole tree as described in Ref. [22]. A most parsimonious reconstruction of the coding-region mutations is shown on the branches.
Mutations are scored relative to the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) [63] and therefore variant nucleotides do not necessarily constitute derived states; the
rCRS is shown by the dashed lines. Suffixes indicate transversions (to A, G, C or T) or indels (C, d); recurrent mutations are underlined. The branching nodes in the phylogeny
are shown in yellow, with the mutations above the node being shared by the derived haplogroups. The naming of haplogroups follows the scheme of [6], opting for the most
compact notation. L3a and L3c denoting novel L3 branches from this study should not to be confused with the obsolete definitions of ‘L3a’ and ‘L3c’ (ZU6a) introduced by
Ref. [64]. The ancestral motifs for the novel haplogroups L7 (corresponding to L4g in Ref. [37]), L3a, and L3c (in italics) have not been determined. However, note that L4 and
L7 (L4g) were clustered together in Ref. [37] because of their sharing of the (unstable) control-region mutation 16362. In addition, observe that there are minor differences with
Ref. [21] in characterizing the mutations for some haplogroups. MtDNA sequences in sky-blue colour boxes are from Ethiopian subjects, whereas those in white boxes are
from Nigerian (sequences 13, 18 and 21) and Dominican (sequences 1–2, 5, 14–16 and 22) subjects. Complete mtDNA sequences, including their control regions, are available
in GenBank, accession numbers DQ341058–DQ341082.

mtDNA pool of modern Europeans, because later immi-
gration from the Near East could have replaced the
descendants of the first settlers.
Sometimeafterthedemicdiffusionhypothesishadbeen
proposed, a debate arose on the issue of the relative
contributionsofNeolithicversusPalaeolithicgenepoolsin
modern Europeans. What was the genetic contribution of
the incipient Neolithic people, who gradually developed
proto-forms of agriculture in the Near Eastw11 000 years
ago, relative to that of the indigenous European hunter-
gatherers, when the Neolithic package first spread into
Europew8000yearsago?Thisdebate–fuelledinitiallyby
mtDNA and later by Y chromosome data – has become
acrimoniousattimes.Thereceivedwisdomofthenineties,
positing that the European gene pool predominantly
resulted from Near Eastern newcomers bringing the
Neolithic culture with them, was first challenged on the
basis of mitochondrial HVS-I variation [40]. The new
suggestion was that only a minority of lineages were a
resultoftheNeolithicimmigration,whereastheremaining
lineages – dating back to between 15 000 and 50 000 years
ago –seemedto haveautochthonous rootsofEarly, Middle
or Late Upper Palaeolithic origin within Europe. The
resultswere,however,rathertentativebecausetheyrelied
on comparisons with a small and inadequate sample from
the Near East. However, further work provided much
stronger evidence that more than three-quarters of
present-day European mtDNAs most likely stemmed
directly from indigenous Mesolithic or Palaeolithic ances-
tors,andalsoshowedthat,withasufficientlylargesample
sizeandabetterresolvedphylogeny[41],putativecladesof
mtDNA exhibit gradients similar to those of other marker
systems [31,32].
This conclusion is supported by some analyses of the
paternally transmitted Y-chromosome [42,43] but not by
other studies that inferred admixture coefficients
considering different potential parental populations [44].
In the context of this debate, the dissection of one minor
autochthonous European mtDNA clade, haplogroup V,
and analyses of its geographic distribution [45,46]
constituted the first clear evidence that Lateglacial
expansions of Palaeolithic populations from refuge areas
in Southern Europe could have had a major impact in
repopulating the continent. Evidence of the overwhelming
importance of the Franco-Cantabrian glacial refuge has
been provided by dissecting haplogroups H – the most
common haplogroup in Europe (40%–50% of mtDNAs) –
and U5 into sub-haplogroups. The age estimates and
geographic distributions of H1, H3, V and U5b (Figure 3)
strongly support a repopulation of much of Western and
Northern Europe from the southwestern refuge zone
in the Late Upper Paleolithic [17,20,47,48]. That this
Lateglacial expansion must have been dramatic is
testified by the dominating star-like structure of
Figure3. The spatial frequency distributions of haplogroups (a) H1; (b) H3; (c) V; and
(d) U5b. Data from the Saami population were not included because of their outlier
haplogroup frequencies, which are probably caused by profound drift and/or
founder events.

sub-haplogroups H1 and H3. It corresponds with an
expansion of radiocarbon dates in Western Europe from
w16 000 years ago, and was probably followed by local
re-expansions fromw11 500 years ago after the relapse to
glacial conditions in the Younger Dryas [49].
On a methodological note, this work has also suggested
that a reliable estimation of the different temporal layers
of input to a sub-continental mtDNA pool should now take
the complete mtDNA phylogeny into full consideration
and work upwards from the potentially earliest layers
(pioneer settlement) to the most recent layers (post-
Neolithic immigration). Having established the basic
features of the Palaeolithic mtDNA pool of Europe
towards the end of the Pleistocene, one could now turn
to the identification of mtDNA lineages that were
introduced later to Europe in Neolithic and post-Neolithic
times. It seems that all of the major haplogroups (U, JT
and R0) now found in Europe were already present in
the Late Palaeolithic times, most of which were then
represented by their major sub-branches. The small but
non-negligible immigration in the Neolithic (and later)
seems to have brought some younger sub-haplogroups,
such as J1b1, J2a and T1a, and perhaps some that are
rare, such as R1, R2 and N1a. The major difficulty in
deciding the entry time of all ‘founder haplotypes’ [41],
including the rarer haplotypes, is the enormous amount of
sampling that is needed to distil a sufficient number of
descendants of the targeted haplotypes across Europe
and the Near East. But simplistic admixture analyses
that are blind to the different time horizons (not to
mention back-migration) and built on unrealistic ad hoc
hypotheses do not provide a short-cut.
Another way to determine the Neolithic contribution to
European mtDNAs has often been envisioned, especially
by archaeologists, in the direct analysis of ancient mtDNA
from Neolithic remains. The difficulties with ancient DNA
of modern humans are well known, and reliable results
could only be expected in extraordinary circumstances
[50,51]. Recently, Haak et al. [52] have apparently
triumphed in the ‘lottery of ancient DNA studies’ (to use
the words of Peter Underhill) by detecting variation in a
minor haplogroup, N1a, from human remains associated
with Linearbandkeramik (LBK) pottery across Central
Europe that partially matches modern European and
Near Eastern haplotypes. This finding, which seems
impossible to explain as artefactual, indicates that
haplogroup N1a was present in Europe 7000 years ago
and suggests that the people involved with the early LBK
culture were initially limited to a small area in the middle
Danube basin, enabling drift effects to occur, whereas
someoftheirdescendantsbegantomigrateandhelpedthe
new culture to spread and develop. Extrapolating from
these data to the ‘Neolithic input’ to Europe as a whole
would, however, be ill-advised, particularly because the
spreadoftheNeolithicinEuropewasnotamonolithic and
homogeneous process and, of course, ‘Neolithic’ does not
equal ‘LBK’, temporally or spatially [53].
Therefore, it seems that there is no short-cut for
distinguishing between autochthonous and immigrated
haplotypes in the modern mtDNA pool at each broad time
interval. Only the systematic screening of particular

would fully interact with population genetics still lies
ahead of us [61] – but is, hopefully, just around the
corner [62].

Perspective and concluding remarks
Mitochondrial DNA, along with DNA from the non-
recombining portion of the Y chromosome, will be used
more and more in elucidating human evolution and
pioneer settlement patterns because, at least for the
moment, autosomal genes lack the high resolution of the
uniparentalmarkers.Aprerequisiteforfutureprogressis,
however, the use of the information from the entire DNA
molecule.Thereisstillmuchworktobedonetofindallthe
polymorphic sites on the Y chromosome, but already the
SNP set provided by Underhill et al. [54,55] has led to a
quantum leap in the phylogeographic insights available
on the male line of descent. The final level of molecular
resolution has already been reached for mtDNA, but the
task of determining and interpreting the worldwide
variation has just begun, with tens of thousands of
mtDNAs to beselected worldwide for complete sequencing
inthenextfewyears.Ofcourse,sequencingentiremtDNA
genomes is much more expensive and is more labour
intensive than the approaches used in the past – but the
efforts are paying off, as the resolution of the mtDNA tree,
and the phylogeographic resolution that goes with it, has
been greatly improved. This can bedemonstrated with the
poor HVS-I resolution around the European consensus
HVS-I sequence, which could ambiguously be allocated to
H/HV*/U*/R* [40], but is resolved by complete sequencing
[17,20,56]. HVS-I based haplogroups can yield a definitely
weaker geographic signal than a comparable number of Y
chromosome SNP haplogroups (for more details, see
Figure 8.1 of Ref. [57]).
The major obstacle (in addition to technical problems)
hasalwaysbeenthereluctanceofpopulationgeneticiststo
make full use of complete or partial coding-region data,
because this would inevitably entail the adoption of
the principles of phylogeography [58] – the systematic
comparison of the sequence data under consideration with
the current database of complete sequences that comprise
the global mtDNA phylogeny, taking into account both
geographic and ethnic distributions of haplogroups and
sub-haplogroups. However, in medical and forensic
genetics, complete mtDNA sequencing is gaining more
attention [11,56,59,60]. A new phase of mutual exchange
mutations from the complete mtDNA phylogeny in large
samples from all over West Eurasia can give us the
