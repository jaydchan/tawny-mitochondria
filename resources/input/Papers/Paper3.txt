The majority of mitochondrial proteins are nuclear
encoded, synthesized in the cytosol, and are post-transla-

Mitochondria perform several fundamental cellular
processes in higher eukaryotes including oxidative
phosphorylation, Fe/S cluster formation and apoptosis.
Dysfunction of the organelle is associated with a wide
range of human diseases. To gain a better understand-
ing of mitochondrial function, several recent proteomic,
genetic, transcriptomic and bioinformatic approaches
have set out to determine the complete set of mito-
chondrially located proteins in yeast, plants and mam-
mals. Here, we review these studies and discuss the
advances and limitations of individual strategies. Inte-
gration of various approaches proves to be a successful
and useful way to identify the mitochondrial proteome
with high sensitivity and specificity. The most com-
prehensive dataset is available for Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, giving an estimated number of 700 different
proteins located in mitochondria.
Mitochondria perform a large number of reactions in
eukaryotic cells. Probably the most impressive of these is
oxidative phosphorylation, in which five major multi-
subunit complexes cooperate to transduce the energy of
nutrient-derived substrates into the energy stored in ATP.
Mitochondria provide the majority of this ATP to the rest
of the cell. Other important reactions occurring in
mitochondria include the Krebs cycle, heme biosynthesis,
b-oxidation offatty acids and metabolism of certain amino
acids. A more recently discovered pathway is the for-
mation and export of Fe/S clusters (Figure 1).
All the proteins catalyzing these reactions occur in an
organelle that is bounded by two membranes and thereby
separated, although not functionally isolated, from the

ca/gobase/gobase.html). A considerable number of mito-
chondrial proteins are involved in the processes of import
and assembly of these nuclear encoded proteins. A group
of chaperones monitors the correct de novo folding of
mitochondrial proteins and participates in decisions about
refolding or degradation. Proteolytic removal of misfolded
proteinsandregulated turnover ofproteins ismediatedby
a series of proteases associated with the various
subcompartments of mitochondria. Some proteins are
involved in the fusion and fission of these organelles,
which in many cases form highly dynamic intercon-
nected networks [1]. These latter proteins are often
indispensable for the proper inheritance of mitochon-
drial DNA, and mutations in some are associated with
human diseases (Box 1).
In addition to these often-complex functions, mitochon-
dria have a key role in apoptosis. Release from mitochon-
driaofcytochromec,apoptosis-inducingfactorandseveral
other proteins promotes programmed cell death [2].
Furthermore, ageing is strongly correlated with impaired
mitochondrial function; for example, the accumulation of
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations was proposed to
lead to premature ageing in mice expressing an error-
prone mitochondrial DNA polymerase g [3].
To gain better insight into the functional networks of
mitochondrial proteins, the complete set must be known.
Several studies in recent years have addressed this aspect
from different angles. Here, we present an overview of
these studies and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of
the various approaches. A major emphasis will be on

proteins by mass spectrometry. Several groups have
purified yeast, mouse and human mitochondria by
classical differential centrifugation, gradient ultracentri-
fugation or free-flow electrophoresis (FFE) [4–9]. Similar
studies onthemitochondrial proteomeofplantshavebeen
undertaken [10–15]. In general, mitochondria were
solubilized and the proteins were separated in various
ways. Isoelectric focusing and subsequent SDS–polyacryl-
amide gel electrophoresis (2D PAGE) is a method that has
majoradvantagesasitofersthepossibilityof,for
instance, comparing a large set of proteins under the
influence of different growth conditions or in response to

the proteins whose levels are affected.
Ohlmeier and colleagues [5] compared the proteome of
baker’s yeast under fermentative versus respiratory
growth. The overall differences were rather minor, as
only18ofthe252identifiedproteins changedsignificantly
in their abundance. However, in this and other studies
using 2D PAGE, a major drawback of this method became
obvious. The set of proteins identified is largely biased
towards abundant and easy-to-solubilize proteins [16].
One possible way to overcome this problem was
exemplified in a thorough and extensive study by
Sickmann et al. [8]. Highly purified mitochondria were

prepared from baker’s yeast and different proteomic
approaches were applied. In addition to 2D PAGE, the
approaches included digestion with different proteases
and subsequent multidimensional liquid chromatography
(MDLC) or electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
(ESI-MS), and one dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (1D SDS–PAGE) with subsequent nano-
scale liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry
(n-LC-MS/MS). In total, O20 million spectra were
recorded, yielding a list of 749 non-redundant mitochon-
drial proteins. In this approach, virtually saturation was
achieved as, in those spectra analyzed at the end, only
very few new proteins were detected compared with those
spectra analyzed in the beginning [8]. About 92% of
already known mitochondrial proteins contained in the
MITOP database [17] were covered by these predicted
mitochondrial proteins. Because the latter reference itself

certain functional classes such as respiratory chain
complexes, this sensitivity of 92% might overestimate
the true coverage of the mitochondrial proteome by this
study (Box 2). Therefore, we chose to use what in our
opinion appears as the best currently available reference
set, the one provided by the MITOP2 database. It

Box 1. Mitochondrial dysfunction in human diseases
Mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) affecting essential
subunits of the respiratory chain or mitochondrial tRNA genes are
associated with a large number of mitochondrial diseases such as
mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-
like episodes (MELAS), myclonic epilepsy and ragged red fiber
disease (MERRF), cardiomyopathy, Leber’s hereditary opticus
neuropathy (LHON), Leigh’s syndrome and many others [40].In
addition, mtDNA alterations have been observed in early tumors of
the liver, prostate, bladder, and head and neck, as well as in
astrocytomas, adenocarcinomas and primary lung tumors and in
Barrett’s oesophagus [41]. For further reading, see Ref. [40] or http://
www.mitomap.org (Table 2).
Mutations in nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins can
also be the cause of human diseases. For example,
(i) Friedreich’s ataxia is caused by mutations in frataxin, a protein
involved in the biogenesis of iron-sulfur protein [42,43].
(ii) Deafness dystonia peptide 1 (DDP1), a protein involved in the
import of proteins into mitochondria, was found to be associated
with Mohr–Tranebjaerg syndrome [44–47].
(iii) Opticus atrophy type I is inherited in an autosomal-dominant
fashion in which the gene coding for the mitochondrial dynamin-like
protein Opa1 is affected [48,49]. Opa1 is involved in maintaining
mitochondrial morphology and its yeast ortholog, Mgm1, was
shown to be essential for mitochondrial fusion [50,51].
(iv) Recently, another component involved in mitochondrial
fusion, Mitofusin-2, was shown to be mutated in families with
Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 2A [52].
In addition to these well-documented diseases, several other
common human diseases are accompanied by mitochondrial
defects. Impairment of glucose and fatty acid metabolism due to
with individual proteins (http://ihg.gsf.de/mitop2; [7,17]).
This reference set contains 477 proteins of which 76%
were identified by Sickmann and colleagues [8] (Table 1).
This is the highest sensitivity (Box 2) so far reported for a
study to evaluate the complete mitochondrial proteome of
a single organism (Table 1). By using a combination of
proteomic approaches, Sickmann and colleagues [8]
minimized the biases and problems associated with the
various individual methods. For example, 2D PAGE
analysis tends to underrepresent hydrophobic proteins
such as peripheral or integral membrane proteins [16].
This was, at least partially, overcome by the combination
of 1D SDS–PAGE and n-LC-MS/MS. Another problem
often encountered is that certain proteins (e.g. small
proteins or proteins with an unusual amino acid compo-
sition) do not yield peptide fragments of suitable size due
to lack of properly spaced cleavage sites. Therefore,

Box 2. Terms and definitions
Sensitivity
The sensitivity of an approach to determine the mitochondrial
proteome is a measure of the probability to detect a mitochondrial
protein by this approach but does not say whether any candidate
protein is truly a mitochondrial protein. It is a measure of the
coverage of an approach as it gives the percentage of known
mitochondrial proteins that were identified by this approach. The
absolute value of the sensitivity depends on the reference set used
and should therefore only be taken as a rough estimate. However,
when the same reference set is always used, it is possible to compare
different approaches with each other (Table 1).
Specificity
The specificity of an approach to determine the mitochondrial
proteome is a measure of the accuracy of a given approach. It can be
estimated from the percentage of the predicted mitochondrial
proteins of this approach that are present in the reference set. This
value is also dependent on the quality of the reference set and only
gives a rough estimate of the accuracy of an approach. For a given
reference set, different approaches can be compared with each
other.
spectrometry (LC-FTICR-MS). Thereby, 28 datasets were
generated, which led to the identification of 546 non-
redundant proteins. Surprisingly, this study revealed
numerous (209) mitochondrial candidates that where not
discovered in the study by Sickmann et al. [8] discussed
above. Conversely, 412 proteins predicted by the latter
study were not detected here. The authors suggest that
many, but not all, of those proteins detected by only one of
the two approaches are non-mitochondrial contaminants
(forfurther reading, we recommend Ref.[7]).This might be
explained by the differences in growth conditions and in
purification methods. Nevertheless, 337 proteins were
detected by both proteomic studies, representing 62% of all
proteins detected by Prokisch et al. [7]. When integrating
both studies, the sensitivity decreases to 49.9% and the
specificity increases to 63.1% (Box 2; Table 1).
Initial studies on the proteome of plant mitochondria
fromA.thalianabasedon2DPAGEandmassspectrometry
led to the identification of nearly 100 non-redundant
proteins [14,15]. The same limitations for low abundance
and hydrophobic proteins as discussed above could be
resolved in a recent study by Heazlewood et al. [11].
and sensitivities are best estimates.
Sensitivity versus specificity
An approach that is only able to predict a limited number of
proteins will therefore always have a low sensitivity (given that
the reference set is much larger). However, when many of these
few predicted proteins are present in the reference set (meaning
that there are presumably few false positives), the specificity is
high. Conversely, an approach that predicts almost all known
proteins in a cell to be localized in the mitochondria will have a
high sensitivity, ut most likely also has a low specificity owing to
the large number of false positives.

Advances and perspectives in proteomic analyses of
mitochondria
The number of false positives in proteomic studies
obviously depends on the purity of isolated mitochondria.
One recent technical development to improve this is the
use of FFE to purify mitochondria [7,18]. Although
solubilization and detection procedures will certainly be
improved in future studies, any proteomic approach is
likely to remain biased against proteins of low abundance
(compare Figure 2a in Ref. [7]) and also proteins that are
difficult to extract from biological samples. Interestingly,
there was no significant bias against the identification of
membrane-associated proteins in the study by Prokisch
and colleagues [7]. This was probably due to specific

in another study, bias against the detection of membrane-
associated proteins was observed [4]. The authors of this
latterstudyattributedthistothelowerproteinabundance
on average of membrane proteins compared with soluble
proteins and not to the limited sensitivity of mass
spectrometry for hydrophobic proteins. Nevertheless,
hydrophobic proteins still appear to be an issue for
approaches based on 2D PAGE [16]. Furthermore, many
proteins are expressed in a conditional manner (for
instance under stress) or at specific stages of growth or
development of an organism. Therefore, it will be difficult
to identify such potentially interesting proteins by a
standard proteomic approach.
Genetics, bioinformatic and transcriptomic approaches
complete the picture
Genetics
Two recent studies report on tagging a large number of
yeast genes and localizing the expressed fusion proteins
by fluorescence microscopy [19,20]. Tagging was carried
out in a systematic manner by fusion of the green
fluorescent protein (GFP) to the C-terminus [19],by
random transposon-mediated mutagenesis, or by cloning
of PCR-amplified open reading frames (ORFs) into an
overexpression/tagging vector [20]. In this way, many
essential and non-essential proteins could be assigned not
only to mitochondria but also to other cellular compart-
ments. As particularly shown in the study by Huh and
colleagues [19], this gives high sensitivity and specificity
when tested against the MITOP2 reference set (Box 2;
Table 1). In a further tagging approach, the N-terminal
halfofasplitGFPwasrandomlyfusedtosequencesfroma
cDNA library and coexpressed with a matrix-targeted
reportercontaining theC-terminalhalf ofGFP [21].When
the expressed fusion protein contained targeting infor-
mation for the mitochondrial matrix, a full-length GFP
was generated by protein splicing. Automated cell sorting
enriched fluorescent clones and subsequent identification
of expressed cDNA fusion proteins became possible. It will
be interesting to see what novel mitochondrial proteins
will be identified by this approach. In its present form, it is
limitedtothedetectionofproteinsexposingtheC-terminus
to the matrix of mitochondria.
All tagging approaches require that expression levels
aresufficientlyhighandthatthetagsdonotinterferewith
correct targeting to the respective location. Furthermore,
changing the authentic amino acid sequence of a protein
(by insertion of a tag), as well as overexpression, can lead
to mislocalization [8]. Additional independent experimen-
tal evidence for a reliable localization of a protein is
desirable; for instance, the similarity of the phenotype of a
strain in which the candidate gene was deleted to the
phenotype of a strain deficient in a known mitochondrial
protein. Respiratory deficiency and slow growth on non-
fermentable carbon sources are two such phenotypes
exploited in large-scale studies [22,23]. These methods
are restricted to non-essential genes and clearly do not
prove that a protein is a mitochondrial protein as, for
example, nuclear transcription factors or cytosolic
www.sciencedirect.com
regulators also affect mitochondrial function. Synthetic
lethality caused by deletion of a candidate gene together
with deletion of a gene encoding a known mitochondrial
protein also indicates a functional and, therefore, often a
physical interaction. Although a large-scale study on
synthetic lethality in baker’s yeast was performed [24],
the results to date have not been analyzed for predicting
mitochondrial proteins.
Transcriptomics
Another approach to detect mitochondrial proteins is to
study the expression level of mRNAs under various
growth conditions. Similar responses in transcript levels
of different genes allow their clustering into groups. These
groups are more likely to represent functionally and
physically interacting protein networks than transcripts
that are differentially regulated. Several synexpression
studies were reported, including genes involved in
mitochondrial functions [25–28].Twoofthoseare
described in Table 1. These studies can predict the
subcellular localization of proteins, albeit only with low-
to-medium specificity.
Bioinformatics
Another possibility to identify proteins located in mito-
chondria is to use in silico predictions. Some predictions
rely on the fact that a large number of proteins targeted to
the matrix or the inner membrane contain a positively
charged, amphipathic N-terminal signal sequence [29–31].
Several algorithms exist that make possible fast and initial
testingforthepresenceofsuchasequence(Tables1and2).
By contrast, proteins targeted to the endoplasmic reticu-
lum or highly positively charged proteins such as
ribosomal subunits also often give high scores, explaining
the low-to-medium specificity of these approaches. Mito-
chondrial proteins containing targeting signals with other
characteristics, in particular internal signals, are being
missed. This group includes inner membrane proteins of
the carrier family (a class of proteins containing six
transmembrane helices and involved in the transport of
small solutes such as ADP or ATP across the inner
membrane), many intermembrane space proteins and
presumably all outer membrane proteins. A more
comprehensive bioinformatic approach has integrated
information derived from genetic, in silico predictions
and correlated mRNA expression datasets using a Baye-
sian probabilistic algorithm [32] (Tables 1 and 2). An
advantage of this type of analysis lies in the possibility of
easily including other types of information such as
proteomic data.
Evolutionary considerations on the origin of the
mitochondrial proteome
Mitochondria are widely believed to have originated
from a single endosymbiotic event in which an
amitochondriate pro-eukaryotic host took up an a-proteo-
bacterial endosymbiont [33,34]. Although most of the
mitochondrial genes have been transferred during evol-
ution to the nucleus, the mitochondrial location and
function of the proteins encoded by these genes often
appear to be maintained. Therefore, a candidate protein

during evolution [33].Therefore,thiskindofanalysis
can, at best, only be taken as an indication for a
mitochondrial location of the corresponding protein.
Integrative approaches
Protein–protein interaction networks
A new possibility of deciphering the proteome of mito-
chondria is to study protein–protein interactions. The
rationale is that any interaction of an unidentified protein
with a known mitochondrial protein reveals its mitochon-
drial location. In addition to the identity of a candidate
protein, one can learn something about its physiological
function, given that there is information about the
interacting partner protein(s). Several large-scale studies
were performed to determine networks of protein–protein
interactions in yeast. They are based on high-throughput
yeast two-hybrid assays, mass spectrometric identifi-
cation of proteins co-purified upon isolation of protein
complexes, correlation of mRNA expression, synthetic
lethality of two genes, and in silico predictions through
genome analysis. These approaches have been analyzed

affinity purification of protein complexes, only rather
stable interactions are detected as well as interactions
that are not disturbed by the affinity tag. Two-hybrid
assays are able to find more-labile interactions but are
particularly prone to false positives (see Ref. [35] for
further discussion). When applied on their own, false
positives are a common drawback of high-throughput
methods. Therefore, the data derived from these various
whole-genome studies were integrated and protein–
protein interactions were grouped in high and medium
confidence classes [35]. To assign novel proteins to
mitochondria by non-proteomic procedures, the curators
of the MITOP2 database (http://ihg.gsf.de/mitop2; [7,17])
used these confidence classes and looked for the presence
of at least one known mitochondrial protein in these
protein–protein interactions (Tables 1 and 2). In doing so,
the mitochondrial location of 154 and 815 proteins,
respectively, was predicted. The sensitivity and specificity

the high-confidence protein–protein interaction class was
analyzed, low sensitivity but high specificity was observed.
Conversely, when using the medium-confidence protein–
protein interaction class, a high sensitivity but a low
specificity was observed (Table 1). This nicely exemplifies
the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.
Integration of transcriptomics and proteomics applied to
animal mitochondria
A rather sophisticated, integrative type of analysis was
reported recently by Mootha and colleagues [4]. It shows

in an exemplary manner how far one can get with a
combination of tissue-based proteomics and a large-scale
mRNA expression analysis. Proteins of highly purified
mitochondria obtained from liver, brain, heart and kidney
were separated by gel filtration and individual fractions
were subjected to digestion and LC-MS/MS. In this way,
409 non-redundant proteins present in at least one tissue
were obtained. By combining these 409 proteins with a
reference set of known mitochondrial proteins and sub-
tracting ten obvious contaminants, they obtained a
‘mitochondria-associated’ set of 591 proteins that were
used for their subsequent analysis. Among the 399 (409
minus ten) proteins detected, 163 represented newly
identified proteins.
We analyzed the data reported by the authors [4] and
determined sensitivity and specificity for individual
tissues. Out of the reference set of 409 mitochondrial
proteins, 217 proteins (53.1% sensitivity) were identified
in at least one tissue (Table 1). For heart, brain, liver and
kidney, the sensitivity was 32.5%, 31.5%, 42.8% and
37.9%,respectively(Table1).Furthermore,oftheproteins

be due to methodological limitations such as under-
sampling but rather can be attributed to, as the authors
suggest, tissue-specific differences. This interpretation
that now integrates transcriptomic and proteomic data is
based on the following arguments. The authors tested
whether a protein identified in one tissue behaves in a
manner that is concordant or not concordant with its
corresponding mRNA. For example, a protein that is
identified in heart but not in liver mitochondria is
considered to behave in a concordant manner when its
mRNA expression level is higher in heart than in liver.
Indeed, there was a strong concordance between protein
identification and mRNA abundance. Furthermore, the
authors used five tissue samples, two from liver and one
each from heart, kidney and brain. Next they determined
the probability that a protein detected in the first liver
sample is detected in the second liver sample and in the
samples from other tissues. For the second liver sample,
this probability was 92%, but 79% on average for the other
tissues.Theauthorsproposeamodelinwhichmitochondria

proteins, of which half are shared between two given
tissues. Two different tissues, therefore, should share

close to the observed 79%.
In addition, the authors determined genes that are
transcriptionally regulated in a similar manner as those
genes encoding mitochondrial proteins identified by
proteomic means. These co-regulated genes extended the
set of ‘mitochondria-associated’ proteins to a so-called
‘mitochondrial neighborhood’ comprising 643 genes
altogether. This work nicely demonstrates the power of
integrative approaches in which proteomic and mRNA
tissue-specific data complement each other.
The most exhaustive integration of proteomic, tran-
scriptomic, bioinformatic and genetic data was reported
recently in an analysis of the mitochondrial proteome of

the set of proteinspresent inthe mitochondria ofmammals
and plants is larger than that offungi.
However, many low-abundance and/or non-extractable
proteins, particularly in mammalian cells, might have
resisted identification so far. Therefore, at present, a
reliable estimate of the total number of mitochondrial
proteins in a given organism is not possible. Further
technological improvements are needed that can be
applied in integrative types of analysis. Tools have to be
developed that allow identification of those ‘hard-to-get’
proteins. A future challenge will be the assignment of all
mitochondrial proteins to their respective submitochon-
drial location such as the outer membrane, the inner
membrane, the matrix and the intermembrane space.
Finally, it should be emphasized that the detailed
functional analysis of each individual protein is
indispensable to achieve a complete understanding of
‘what makes us breathe’.

those discussed in detail above. Overlaps between differ-
ent approaches were analyzed. For each protein, a value
termedtheMITOP2scorewascalculated–thisrepresents
the specificity of the best combination of methods (http://
ihg.gsf.de/mitop2). The MITOP2 score has a range 0–100,
indicating a low-to-high probability of a protein being
located in mitochondria. The power of this type of
integration is impressively exemplified when the
MITOP2 score is used as a criterion to predict mitochon-
drial proteins. The authors calculated the specificity and
sensitivity of the different protein sets when a MITOP2
scoreO90, 93, 95, 96 or 97 was used. This was superior in
terms of high sensitivity, still maintaining a high
specificity when compared with any single approach
applied so far (compare with Figure 4 in [7]). This is also
evident from our comparison in Table 1, where using a
MITOP2 score O95 yields a specificity of 69.5% and a
sensitivity of 81.1%.
Outlook
The goal of determining the complete set of mitochondrial
proteins is getting closer. But how far are we now? On the
basis of the most exhaustive study on the mitochondrial
proteome of S. cerevisae so far, w700 proteins are
predicted to be located in this organelle [7]. This is a
conservative estimate that yielded a relatively low number
of mitochondrial proteins as compared with earlier esti-
mates of 800 [20], and compared with corresponding
estimates for A. thaliana (2800) or humans (1500–4200
[36,37]). Mammalian mitochondria are involved in several
processes that do not occur in yeast mitochondria
(e.g. nonshivering thermogenesis, steroid biosynthesis and
apoptosis). Tissue-specific and developmentally regulated
proteins or isoforms are likely to increase further the
number of mitochondrial proteins in higher organisms.
