standing a complex biological system, such as the mitochondrion, requires the
identification of the complete repertoire of proteins targeted to the organelle, the
characterization of these, and finally, the elucidation of the functional and
physical interactions that occur within the mitochondrion. In the last decade,
significant developments have contributed to increase our understanding of the
mitochondrion, and among these, computational research has played a signif-
icant role. Not only general bioinformatics tools have been applied in the
context of the mitochondrion, but also some computational techniques have
been specifically developed to address problems that arose from within the
mitochondrial research field. In this review the contribution of bioinformatics to
mitochondrial biology is addressed through a survey of current computational
methods that can be applied to predict which proteins will be localized to the
mitochondrion and to unravel their functional interactions.
genomic context; proteome
THE DETAIL AND ACCURACY with which we can model the system-
level properties of the mitochondrion relies substantially on
how comprehensive our knowledge is about its individual
components and their corresponding interactions. In recent
years, great progress has been achieved toward the identifica-
tion of the complete set of proteins that perform their functions
inside the mitochondrion, the so-called mitochondrial pro-
teome. For instance, advances in subcellular proteomics have
allowed the isolation of 615 proteins from human heart mito-
chondria (60), and the combination of experimental research
with genomics and sequence analyses has expanded the set of
mitochondrial proteins to nearly a thousand (13). Nevertheless,
despite these efforts, a substantial fraction of the human mito-
chondrial proteome, estimated to contain about 1500 proteins
(37), remains still unidentified. Moreover, a large fraction of
the identified proteins have unknown functions, and for many
of the rest the knowledge of their biological roles is just
general.
During the last decade, the concourse of computational
biology in mitochondrial research has been essential. For
instance, bioinformatics tools have been widely used for pre-
dicting which proteins are targeted to the mitochondrion and
for identifying their functional homologs. More recently, a
number of novel computational techniques that integrate dif-
ferent sources of data and unravel new functional interactions
among proteins have been developed (24). These techniques,
known as context-based function prediction methods, are in-
creasingly being used in the context of the mitochondrial
proteome and have proven especially useful for the identifica-
tion of novel disease genes. Here I survey the most prominent
computational biology methods that are used in the field of
mitochondrial biology, from the first sequence analysis algo-
rithms that identify mitochondrial proteins, to the most sophis-
ticated comparative genomics techniques that integrate differ-
ent sources to predict functional interactions.
IDENTIFYING THE COMPLETE REPERTOIRE OF
MITOCHONDRIAL PROTEINS
Perhaps one of the first computational approaches to be
specifically applied to the mitochondrion was the development
of sequence-based algorithms to detect mitochondrial targeting
signals (12, 44). These methods are usually based on the
detection of common properties of NH
2
-terminal signal pep-
tides present in many mitochondrial proteins. These common
sequence features result from physical constrains imposed by
the processes of recognition and translocation across the mi-
tochondrial membranes. For instance, as a consequence of the
net positive charge needed during theH9004H9023-driven import across
the inner membrane (67), mitochondrial targeting peptides are
enriched in positively charged residues and lack negatively
charged ones. Additionally, they can form amphiphilic H9251-he-
lices, which are used to bind the receptors at the mitochondrial
outer membrane (1). Such physical parameters are computed
by MitoProt (12) to derive a linear function, which is then
compared with a cutoff for mitochondrial/non-mitochondrial
localization prediction. Other methods, such as TargetP (19),

SignalP (44), or Predotar (55), use neural network predictors
that are trained on sets of proteins with known localization.
Although these methods display a decent specificity, their use
on a genomic scale can give rise to rather high false-positive
rates, because the prior probability of a protein being mito-
chondrial is low. For instance, TargetP, with 91% specificity
and 60% sensitivity, gives rise to a 69% false-positive rate,
when applied at a genomic scale, since only 7% of the human
proteome is localized to the mitochondrion (9). Moreover, a
common limitation of all these methods is that they cannot
detect proteins whose mitochondrial localization is mediated
by internal signals (30). To avoid this, other computational
methods have been developed that are independent of the
presence of targeting signals. For instance, MITOPRED (31) is
based on the Pfam domain occurrence patterns and the amino
acid compositional differences encountered between mito-
chondrial and nonmitochondrial proteins. Yet another strategy
to predict mitochondrial localization is based on the analysis of
the phylogenetic profile of a protein, that is its pattern of
presence/absence in a set of genomes (39). The idea behind this
approach is that the endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria from
within the alpha-proteobacteria would be reflected in the phy-
logenetic profiles of their proteomes, and, therefore, eukaryotic
proteins with homologs in alpha-proteobacterial species are
expected to have mitochondrial localization. Despite the great
expectations raised by this original method, current knowledge
on the evolution of the mitochondrial proteome makes it
advisable to use this with caution, since most of the mitochon-
drial proteins do not originate from the alpha-proteobacteria,
and a considerable fraction of proteins derived from this
bacterial group have a nonmitochondrial localization (25, 26).
Nevertheless, the presence of homologs in Rickettsia
prowazekii is still used, in combination with other lines of
evidence, as indicative for mitochondrial localization (9, 51).
For many years computational prediction was the only
feasible technique to obtain a broad view of the mitochondrial
protein complement, since experimental approaches to charac-
terize protein localization were not amenable for use at a large
scale. More recently, advances in experimental techniques,
such as large-scale green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagging
(32) and subcellular proteomics (70), are paving the way to the
complete experimental characterization of the mitochondrial
proteome. So far, quite comprehensive proteomics sets exist
for human (60) and some model organisms such as mouse (40)
and yeast (54). An obvious advantage of experimental tech-
niques over computational predictions is that the former can be
specifically applied to different tissues (21) or under different
experimental conditions, thus obtaining a snapshot of the
proteins localized to the mitochondrion in a given context.
Moreover, proteomics are more informative in the sense that
they provide quantitative measures of the abundance of each
identified protein. Common pitfalls of proteomics techniques,
however, are that they are usually biased toward abundant
proteins and that they often miss proteins that are difficult to
extract and analyze, e.g., integral membrane proteins.
An optimal solution to overcome the different limitations of
the various methods is the integration of their results. Such an
approach is used by the MitoP2 mitochondrial proteome data-
base (51). This server integrates data from computational
prediction and subcellular proteomics techniques, but also
results from other experiments that might be indicative of
mitochondrial localization. These include, among others,
mRNA expression profiles (40), phenotypes (6) and large-scale
GFP-tagging screenings (48). All these different lines of evi-
dence are subsequently combined in a single score, the MitoP2
score (52). This score considers the different specificities, that
is, the percentage of proteins detected by each method (and
their combinations) that is part of a reference data set. A recent
implementation of MitoP2 (51), although still only applied to
yeast mitochondria, uses support vector machines (SVMs) to
combine all different data sets. SVMs are learning machines
that can be trained to solve classification tasks (69). In the case
of MitoP2 the SVM is trained, with a reference set, to classify
proteins as mitochondrial or nonmitochondrial, according to a
20-dimensional input-vector that comprises the results for this
protein in 20 different data sets. A similar integrative approach
to predict human mitochondrial proteins was used by Calvo
and co-workers (9). In this case they combined eight different
sources of information and used a naı¨ve Bayes classifier, called
Maestro, trained on a reference data set of known mitochon-
drial proteins. Assuming independence between the different
lines of evidence, this classifier employs Bayesian statistics to
compute, for each protein, a likelihood of being mitochondrial.
Figure 1 shows differences in sensitivity and specificity for
most of the methods discussed, in all cases the same reference
data set was used for the benchmark. As it can be seen,
integrative approaches, such as that of MitoP2 or the Bayesian
classifier are clearly superior to any other method used in
isolation. The repertoire of mitochondrial proteins is thus
rapidly increasing and several dedicated repositories provide
listings of mitochondrial proteins, including sequence and

functional information (4, 13, 51). Considering the significant
advances that have been achieved in the last few years, the full
identification of the human mitochondrial proteome within the
coming years seems a feasible goal.
HOMOLOGY-BASED FUNCTIONAL INFERENCE
Identifying the pieces that form the mitochondrial proteome
constitutes only the first step toward the characterization of the
system-level properties of the mitochondrion. To properly
assemble the different mitochondrial components, it is neces-
sary to first identify their functions. This is ideally done
through experimental research, in which by subsequent assays
one can functionally characterize a given protein or pathway.
This process has been greatly accelerated by recent develop-
ments in high-throughput techniques that are able to produce
experimental data for thousands of genes in one go. However,
despite these efforts the experimental characterization of pro-
teins is still a time consuming and expensive task. Fortunately,
there are a number of computational techniques that can be
exploited to assign function to experimentally uncharacterized
proteins.
The classic and most widely used strategy to computation-
ally annotate a protein consists of a transfer of knowledge from
an experimentally annotated protein to its uncharacterized
homologs, a technique called homology-based function predic-
tion. A complete survey of homology-based function predic-
tion methods is beyond the scope of this section and has been
covered in specific reviews (53). Here, I will just provide a
very brief overview, focusing on some cautionary remarks
regarding the interpretation of the results.
The main advantage of homology-based function prediction
resides in that it reduces the process of experimentally char-
acterizing a protein to the much simpler task of finding an
annotated homolog in a sequence database. For this purpose,
there are a plethora of tools and websites that can be used. The
most popular algorithms to detect significant similarities
among protein sequences include Smith-Waterman (57) and
BLAST (2). More sensitivity in the searches can be achieved
by profile-based approaches such as Psi-Blast (3) or HMMER
(17). The proliferation of user-friendly servers, in which non-
specialists can perform homology searchers, has facilitated the
popularization of homology-based function prediction. It must
be noted, however, that its use is not always straightforward
and some caution must be taken when extrapolating functional
annotations among proteins. This is particularly true when the
comparisons involve sequences from distantly related species.
Firstly, homologous proteins tend to share a common function
at the molecular level, but this function can be performed in the
context of completely different biological processes. For in-
stance, two homologous protein kinases may trigger different
signaling pathways and thus play a completely different bio-
logical role. Secondly, small changes in the amino acid se-
quence of a protein might result in significant variations of its
function, e.g., a change in the substrate specificity of an
enzyme. These, and other sources of errors might lead to
incorrect annotations that can be rapidly propagated in se-
quence databases. It is, therefore, important to always consider
the original source of the annotation provided by annotation
frameworks such us Gene Ontology (28). Another useful
advice is to consider not only the best hit in a sequence
similarity search but to globally inspect a wider range of
homologs down in the hit list. This will provide us with
information on whether the function is conserved among that
protein family. Another important consideration is to evaluate
whether the sequence similarity extends over the full lengths of
both sequences or if it is, otherwise, restricted to a given
domain. The finding of partial-length homology can be useful
if the function of the region of homology is known in one of the
proteins. In this context, the search against domain databases
such as Pfam (5) or SMART (36) can be of great help.
Finally, the accuracy of homology-based function prediction
can be increased if orthology, rather than just homology,
relationships are used. Two proteins are orthologous to each
other when they evolved by speciation from a common ances-
tral sequence, in contrast to paralogs, which evolved by gene
duplication (20, 22). Orthology is a relevant concept for func-
tion prediction since orthologs are, relative to paralogs, more
likely to perform the same function. Orthology relationships
should ideally be assessed through the detection of speciation
and duplication events in a phylogenetic analysis (22). How-
ever, since phylogenetic reconstruction is a computationally
heavy task, alternative methods, which only rely on sequence
similarity searches, are more generally used. These include
“best bi-directional hits” (33) and its multiple-genome exten-
sions such as COG (59) or inparanoid (45).
The impact that homology-based function prediction has had
in the annotation of proteins is beyond any doubt. However, it
does not represent the definitive solution to the problem of the
full functional characterization of mitochondrial proteins. After
applying homology-based function prediction techniques, a
great fraction of the mitochondrial proteome remains unanno-
tated, and for many of the rest our knowledge on their function
is just general. Fortunately, the genome era has inspired the
development of novel computational methods that provide
functional information that is complementary to that of homol-
ogy-based function prediction (24). These so-called context-
based methods are described in the next section.
CONTEXT-BASED FUNCTION PREDICTION
Context-based methods exploit genome comparisons to de-
fine the so-called genomic context of a gene. Here the term
“context” is used to refer to any kind of information at a
genomic scale, from the positions of the genes along the
chromosomes, to their specific evolutionary history. If two
genes share a particular context and this is significantly con-
served during evolution, then a functional interaction between
these two genes can be inferred. This functional interaction is
usually of a different nature from that predicted by homology-
based function prediction. While homology-based methods
provide information on the function of a protein at a molecular
level, e.g., its enzymatic activity, genomic-context methods
provide information about the biological process in which that
protein is playing a role, e.g., biochemical pathway. Thus
ideally both approaches should be used in combination to
increase the specificity of the functional predictions. Three
main types of genomic context associations are generally used
(Fig. 2): 1) physical proximity in the genome, 2) coevolution in
terms of sequence and/or phylogenetic distribution, and 3)

conservation of shared performance in genome-wide experi-
ments.
In the late nineties it was shown that the conservation of
chromosomal proximity of two genes (Fig. 2A) might be
indicative of related function (15, 47). This is especially true
for bacterial genomes in which genes coding for enzymes in a
common pathway are often organized in operons. In eu-
karyotes, the proximity of two genes in the genome is rarely
indicative of related function, although there are several re-
markable examples, such as the polycistronic transcripts in
nematodes (7). Therefore these techniques are especially suited
to mitochondrial proteins that have bacterial homologs, assum-
ing that the functional relationships are conserved between the
eukaryotic and bacterial counterparts. A special case of chro-
mosomal proximity is that of fused genes (Fig. 2B). The
finding of a fusion between two genes in another genome is
usually a strong indication for a physical interaction between
the proteins encoded therein (38).
Regardless of the proximity in the chromosome, being
encoded in the same genome can be a prerequisite for func-
tional interaction. Thus the finding of two genes that co-occur
in many genomes and are missed from many others suggests
that they likely participate in the same biological process (34,
68, 71). This technique, called gene co-occurrence or phylo-
genetic profiling (Fig. 2C) compares the patterns of presence/
absence of proteins in a set of complete genomes and infers
Fig. 2. Overview of the most widely used context-based function prediction methods. A functional relationship between two genes (center) can be inferred from:
A, chromosomal proximity, both genes are close to each other in a significant number of genomes; B, gene fusion/fission, both genes form a single gene in other
genome(s); C, phylogenetic profiling, both genes have similar 1) or complementary 2) phylogenetic profiles in a number of genomes from diverse species; D,
correlation of gene loss and/or duplication events, the history of losses and duplications of both families is similar; E, correlated mutations, pairs of positions,
one from each family’s protein alignment, vary in the same species; this might indicate that these positions physically interact. In other words, if mutations in
position X of protein A are found to be significantly associated (they co-occur in many species), with mutations in position Y of protein B, the prediction can
be made that proteins A and B physically interact and that residues Y and X are involved in this interaction. In the example, residues 5, 67, 212, and 310 of the
first alignment mutate in the same species as residues 124, 330, 32, and 159, respectively, from the second alignment; F, correlation of their performance in
genome-wide experiments, especially when this correlation is conserved between different experiments and/or different species; G, similarity of the phylogenetic
trees of both protein families; this can be measured, as in the example, by the correlation coefficient of the distance matrices from both trees.

functional interactions between proteins with similar profiles
(50). Refinements of this approach (Fig. 2D) include the use of
the evolutionary relationships among the species considered to
identify correlated gene loss or duplication events (23). Other
variants that use the coevolution of proteins to predict their
function exploit the information contained in the sequences or
in the phylogenetic trees. For instance, phylogenies from in-
teracting protein families, such as the chemokine-receptor
system (29), are more similar to each other than expected from
the species phylogeny. Such correlated evolution can be de-
tected by comparing pairs of trees (63) (Fig. 2G) or detecting
compensatory mutations from the protein alignments that would
indicate a possible protein-protein interaction (49) (Fig. 2E).
The third type of genomic context, consists of the perfor-
mance of genes in genome-wide experiments (Fig. 2F). So far,
gene expression studies and large-scale protein-protein inter-
action screenings are the types of experimental genomic con-
text that have been most widely used (64, 65). The inherent
noisy nature of this kind of data can be reduced by searching
for conservation of the shared genomic context for a pair of
genes. This can be done by comparing different experiments in
a single species (vertical comparative genomics) or by com-
paring results of similar experiments in different species (hor-
izontal comparative genomics). Although still far from the
overall popularity of homology-based function prediction
methods, context-based methods are slowly becoming a gen-
eral tool for researchers, thanks to user-friendly servers such as
STRING (66).
CLINICAL RELEVANCE OF CONTEXT-BASED FUNCTION
PREDICTION: SOME SUCCESSFUL CASE-STORIES
Although still in their infancy, context-based function pre-
diction methods have already produced a decent number of
successful examples that underscore their validity and appli-
cability. Here I will describe a few case stories, that besides
illustrating the mechanics of context-based function prediction
in the mitochondrion, have been applied to disease-related
processes and thus are of clinical importance. A pioneering
case of context-based function prediction applied to a mito-
chondrial disease is that of the functional annotation of the
frataxin gene, in which the phylogenetic profiling technique
was used (Fig. 2C). For many years, a triplet expansion in an
intron of this gene was known to cause the human degenerative
disease Friedreich ataxia (10). This slowly progressive disorder
of the nervous and muscular systems is caused by a degener-
ation of nerve tissue in the spinal chord and nerves extending
to peripheral areas, such as the arms and legs. With time, this
damage leads to the inability to coordinate voluntary muscle
movements, without deterioration of mental capacity. Al-
though the mutation causing the disease was well character-
ized, the molecular function of the frataxin gene and the
mechanism by which the mutation was causing the disease
remained elusive. By applying the phylogenetic profiling tech-
nique, Huynen and coworkers (35) noted that the frataxin gene
displayed the same phylogenetic distribution as several other
genes involved in the assembly of iron-sulfur clusters in the
mitochondrion. Frataxin is present in all eukaryotic genomes
analyzed, but its pattern of presence/absence among bacterial
genomes is quite distinctive. For instance, it was present in the
alpha-proteobacterium R. prowazekii, but absent from the
closely related Mesorhizobium loti and Caulobacter crescen-
tus. Exactly the same pattern in all genomes studied was found
for hscA and hscB genes, known to be involved in the assembly
of the iron-sulfur cluster and suggesting a similar role for
frataxin. This hint inspired researchers in the field and, only a
year later, several independent experimental results that con-
firmed a role of frataxin in the iron-sulfur cluster assembly
pathway were published (11, 16, 42).
The frataxin case constitutes an example of how one can
predict the function of an uncharacterized protein by identify-
ing the biological process in which it is playing a role. Con-
versely, genomic-context information can also be exploited
when no candidate genes are available but, instead, the goal is
to identify them. Such reverse strategy was applied by Gabal-
do´n and colleagues in their search for genes involved in
complex I deficiency (27), using this time the correlation of
gene gain and loss technique (Fig. 2D). Complex I deficiency
consists of a reduced activity in the mitochondrial respiratory
chain enzyme NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I).
Such an impairment may be present in a variety of forms and
often results in multisystem disorders associated with a fatal
outcome at a young age (62). The intricate macromolecular
structure of complex I, comprising 46 subunits (8), complicates
the task of identifying the disease-causing gene, since muta-
tions in almost any of its subunits can, in principle, result in
complex I deficiency (56). In the worst scenario, after sequenc-
ing all known complex I subunits in patients with hereditary
complex I deficiency, the disease-causing mutation may re-
main unidentified. This suggests that the mutation possibly lies
in a gene coding for an unknown subunit or a protein directly
or indirectly involved in complex I function (e.g., an assembly
factor). To help with identifying such genes, Gabaldo´n and
colleagues performed a large-scale phylogenetic analysis in-
volving all subunits of complex I (27). Additionally, they
searched for proteins with a gene loss profile similar to that of
core complex I subunits (23). One of the candidate genes
identified, coding for an uncharacterized protein, showed a
number of characteristics that were indicative of a tight func-
tional link with complex I. First, the gene itself (later named
B17.2-like or B17.2L) is homologous to the known complex I
accessory subunit B17.2. Second, the evolutionary reconstruc-
tion of this family reveals that, after a gene duplication event
occurred at the early stages of eukaryotic evolution, both
paralogous genes evolved in a similar fashion. Most remark-
ably, both genes have been concomitantly lost from species
that also lack complex I such as the fungi Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Encephalitozoon
cuniculi. Such a pattern of coevolution strongly suggests a
similar role for B17.2L in complex I function. Only an accel-
erated evolution of this paralogous group, indicated by the long
branches in the tree, suggested a possible subfunctionalization.
The experimental confirmation that B17.2L is indeed involved
in complex I function came soon, when this gene was found to
be mutated in patients with a complex I deficiency associated
with progressive encephalopathy (46). The molecular charac-
terization of the protein encoded by B17.2L showed that it was
not a permanent component of complex I, but was rather
functioning as a chaperone in its assembly process (46).

In some other cases, the experimentalists do have a list of
candidate genes that might be causing the disease, but this set
is just too long and sequencing or testing all candidates
becomes infeasible. In such cases, computational approaches
can be used to prioritize the candidates and thus allow not only
a faster identification of the disease-causing mutation, but also
a more rational use of available resources. All context-based
techniques can be used in isolation, but a higher specificity is
expected if a combination of methods is used. Initial integra-
tive analysis for discovering genes involved in mitochondrion-
associated diseases combined few sources of data to prioritize
genes found in a homozygosity region known to cause the
disease. For instance, Mootha and colleagues (41) identified
the gene causing cytochrome c oxidase deficiency by combin-
ing proteomics and a large-scale gene expression data set. For
all genes encoded in the candidate regions they evaluated they
likelihood of being mitochondrial by analyzing their profiles in
subcellular proteomics and comparing their expression profiles
with those of known mitochondrial proteins. Among the 15
genes encoded in the candidate region, only the mRNA binding
protein LRPPRC was found to be clearly associated with
mitochondria. The sequencing of that gene in patient samples
identified the mutation causing the disease. Later, the same
method served to identify mutations in the mitochondrial
ETHE1 gene as the origin of ethylmalonic encephalopathy
(61). More recently, integrative approaches have incorporated
a growing number of data sources to identify disease genes in
candidate regions. This allows applying these methods to
larger lists of genes. An example of such a case is the
identification of a genomic rearrangement in the succinyl-CoA
synthase (SUCLA2) gene as the origin of a severe encephalo-
myopathy (18). A genome-wide homozygosity screen, in a
family with several members affected by an autosomal reces-
sive encephalomyopathy allowed the identification of a shared
homozygosity region of 20 Mb on chromosome 13. This region
contains 103 open reading frames, a list just too long for a
comprehensive experimental testing. Since the disease was
specifically associated with a mtDNA depletion and a reduced
activity in several mitochondrial respiratory complexes, the
researchers decided to prioritize the candidate genes according
to their possible mitochondrial localization. For this purpose,
they employed the MitoP2 score and reduced the original list to
only those three candidate genes that presented a MitoP2 score
higher than 60. Subsequent experimental characterization of
their sequences identified the disease-causing genomic rear-
rangement in the SUCLA2 gene. A similar approach, but this
time using the Maestro Bayesian classifier (9), identified the
mitochondrial inner membrane protein MPV17 as the disease
gene associated with an infantile hepatic mitochondrial DNA
depletion (58).
Concluding Remarks
To provide a very brief summary of the current state of the
art regarding the functional characterization of the mitochon-
drion it can be said that 1) we are quickly approaching the full
identification of the mitochondrial proteome; 2) besides some
well-studied pathways, our understanding of the functional
interactions that occur within the mitochondrion is still rather
incomplete. The systematic functional characterization of mi-
tochondrial proteins and the elucidation of their functional
interactions will ultimately pave the way to the reconstruction
of an in silico model for the human mitochondrion, which
constitutes the ultimate goal of mitochondrial systems biology.
Such a model could be used to predict the dynamics and
patterns of response of the mitochondrion under certain con-
ditions, to test theoretical assumptions, and even to perform
virtual experiments that would be otherwise infeasible. We are
witnessing the first serious attempts to produce reliable com-
putational models of the mitochondrion, an emerging field that
is the focus of other articles in the present journal issue. If we
compare the present situation with those of twenty, ten and five
years ago, there is no doubt that the functional characterization
of the mitochondrion has experienced a significant accelera-
tion. Computational biology has played a major role in this
process, and it is likely that, its relative contribution to our
understanding of the mitochondrion will only grow in the
coming years.
