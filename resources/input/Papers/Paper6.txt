Abstract
Background: Mitochondria play a vital role in the energy production and apoptotic process of
eukaryotic cells. Proteins in the mitochondria are encoded by nuclear and mitochondrial genes.
Owing to a large increase in the number of identified mitochondrial protein sequences and
completed mitochondrial genomes, it has become necessary to provide a web-based database of
mitochondrial protein information.
Results: We present ‘MitoInteractome’, a consolidated web-based portal containing a wealth of
information on predicted protein-protein interactions, physico-chemical properties, polymorphism, and
diseases related to the mitochondrial proteome. MitoInteractome contains 6,549 protein sequences
which were extracted from the following databases: SwissProt, MitoP, MitoProteome, HPRD and Gene
Ontology database. The first general mitochondrial interactome has been constructed based on the
concept of ‘homologous interaction’ usingPSIMAP(ProteinStructuralInteractomeMAP)andPEIMAP
(Protein Experimental Interactome MAP). Using the above mentioned methods, protein-protein
interactions were predicted for 74 species. The mitochondrial protein interaction data of humans was
used to construct a network for the aging process. Analysis of the ‘aging network’ gave us vital insights
into the interactions among proteins that influence the aging process.
Conclusion: MitoInteractome is a comprehensive database that would (1) aid in increasing our
understanding of the molecular functions and interaction networks of mitochondrial proteins,
(2) help in identifying new target proteins for experimental research using predicted protein-
protein interaction information, and (3) help in identifying biomarkers for diagnosis and new
molecular targets for drug development related to mitochondria. MitoInteractome is available at
http://mitointeractome.kobic.kr/.

Background
The mitochondrion, a membrane bound organelle, is
often described as "the cellular power plant". It plays a
critical role in energy production, metabolism, apopto-
sis, cellular proliferation, and other essential cellular
processes. Consequently, mitochondrial dysfunctions
result in disorders ranging from energy metabolism
defects to neuro-degenerative diseases such as Parkin-
son’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease [1]. The association
of mitochondria to these disorders has driven experi-
mental approaches to define the mitochondrial pro-
teome. Recently, proteomics approaches based on 2D-
gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry were
employed to estimate the size of mitochondrial pro-
teomes of individual species. Bardel et al. separated 433
protein spots in Pisum sativum (peas) mitochondrial
proteome [2], while Kruft et al. separated 650 different
Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress) mitochondrial proteins
[3] and estimated that 1,500 - 2,000 nuclear genes
encode mitochondrial proteins. Taylor et al. separated
615 proteins from normal human heart tissue mito-
chondria and estimated the total human mitochondrial
proteome to be about 1,500 proteins [4]. Owing to a
steady increase in the amount of information, a
comprehensive web-based information portal unifying
mitochondrial proteome information has become a
necessity.
In order to gain an in-depth understanding of the
molecular functions and processes of mitochondria, it is
essential to examine the interactions among its proteins.
Here, we introduce ‘MitoInteractome’,aconsolidated
multi-species database for mitochondrial research that
integrates information relevant to functions, pathways,
diseases, non-synonymous SNP effects, protein-protein
interactions, and physico-chemical properties. Further,
we present an application of MitoInteractome in the
construction and analysis of a protein interaction
network for the ‘aging’ process.
Construction and content
Data source
The primary dataset for MitoInteractome was generated
by performing a keyword search against SwissProt http://
www.expasy.ch/sprot/ and including subsets from MitoP
http://www.mitop.de:8080/mitop2/[5], MitoProteome
http://www.mitoproteome.org/[6], HPRD http://www.
hprd.org[7], and Gene Ontology (GO) database http://
www.geneontology.org[8]. Proteins for which GO infor-
mation was unavailable, in order to filter out false
positives, we used the following algorithms that predict
the sub-cellular localization of a given protein: 1) Psort
http://psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/[9], 2) TargetP http://
www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP/[10], and 3) Predotar
http://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/predotar/predotar.html[11].
Onlytheproteinsthatwerepredictedtobemitochondrial
by all the three algorithms were included. The refined
primary dataset had 6,549 proteins spanning over 74
species. The flow-chart illustrating the process of collec-
tion of primary data and its refinement can be found in
the supplement section of the MitoInteractome website
http://mitointeractome.kobic.kr/supplement.php.
Construction of complete MitoInteractome database is
illustrated in Figure 1. We classified proteins based on
their functional process and sub-mitochondrial localiza-
tion when applicable. The classifications are illustrated
in Figure 2.
Protein interaction prediction
Protein-protein interactions are diverse, but all occur in a
highly specific manner determined by the structural and
physico-chemical properties of the interacting partners.
We used two methods to predict protein interactions:
PSIMAP (Protein Structural Interactome MAP) (http://
psimap.com, http://psibase.kobic.re.kr) [12,13] and PEI-
MAP (Protein Experimental Interaction MAP) [14].

PSIMAP is a structure based interaction prediction
method. It predicts interactions between known PDB
http://www.rcsb.org/pdb domains based on the Eucli-
dean distance between them. Two domains are assigned
as ‘interacting’ if they have five or more atoms within 5 Å
́
distance. To construct the mitochondrial proteomes, we
first assigned known 3D structural families in SCOP [15]
to mitochondrial protein data sets. Among 6,549
mitochondrial proteins, 2,161 (32.99%) had at least
one sequence homologous to the domain(s) in SCOP,
based on the BLAST sequence similarity search with the
following parameters: percentage identity: 40%,
sequence coverage: 70%, and e-value: 10
-4
. However,
the same region of a protein sequence could be assigned
and overlapped by more than two SCOP families, each
of which falls within the same significance level. In these
cases, we accepted overlaps of up to 15 amino acid
residues in the alignments and regarded them as two
separate domains for a given protein sequence. Using
PSIMAP, we found 36,359 structural interaction pairs
from the mitochondrial proteomes.
Structural interaction information tends to provide more
number of predictions as many specifically different
sequencessharethesamestructure.Therefore,experiment
based sequence based PPI data are usually more specific.
Ourusual stepistopredictmanypartnersusingstructural
interaction information and then apply sequence based
experimental (more specific incident of protein-protein
interaction) PPI data to filter out the first.
PEIMAP (Protein Experimental Interaction MAP) uses
experimental data available in BIND http://bond.unlea-
shedinformatics.com[16], DIP http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.
edu[17], MINT http://mint.bio.uniroma2.it/mint[18],
IntAct http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact[19], and HPRD inter-
action databases as a basis for prediction. The interac-
tions are predicted based on the concept of ‘homologous
interaction’,whichmeansthatiftwoproteinsina
species, are known to be interacting, then their respective
orthologs in another species are also likely to interact. An
illustration of the concept of homologous interaction
and the required parameters for the same are available in
the supplement section of MitoInteractome’swebsite.
The mitochondrial proteins were aligned with the
protein sequences involved in, experimentally known,
protein interactions using BLAST (cut-off sequence
identity of 80%). Using PEIMAP we found 23,973
interaction pairs.
Disease related information, nsSNPs and their effects
Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with a large
number of aging-related neurodegenerative diseases such
as Alzheimer’sdisease,Parkinson’s disease, Amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis, and Huntington’sdisease[20].Todate,
102 heritable disorders have been attributed to defects in
a quarter of the known nuclear-encoded mitochondrial
proteins in humans. More than 60 disorders have been
reported to be derived from mutations in the human
mitochondrial genome. Many mitochondrial diseases
remain unexplained, however, partly because only
40~60% of the presumed 700-1,000 proteins involved
in mitochondrial function and biogenesis have been
identified [21]. Our primary source of information on
diseases was OMIM http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
Omim/[22]. The number of base substitutions sites in
the mitochondrial genome related to cytopathies was 74
[23]. Information associated with mitochondrial dis-
eases can be accessed using the search form available at
http://mitointeractome.kobic.kr/search.php.
It is widely accepted that polymorphisms in the human
genome are expected to play a key role in defining the
etiologic basis of phenotypic differences amongst indi-
viduals in the aspect of drug responses and common
disease predisposition [24]. Non-synonymous SNPs are
known to be closely associated with inherited diseases.
MitoInteractome contains 1301 non-synonymous SNPs,

collected from dbSNP http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
projects/SNP/ build 129 [25], associated with 512
human mitochondrial proteins. We analysed the non-
synonymous SNPs using PolyPhen http://genetics.bwh.
harvard.edu/pph/[26], a tool that predicts the impact of
non-synonymous SNPs on structure and function of
proteins. The non-synonymous SNPs were classified
based on the confidence score of their potency to be
deleterious. 321 substitutions were predicted to be
probably damaging and 226 were predicted as possibly
damaging, while the rest were predicted as benign
substitutions.
Pathway information
Pathway information is vital for successful quantitative
modeling of biological systems. Mitochondria have been
implicated in the origin of diseases, because of their
crucial role in energy production, in nuclear cytoplasmic
signal integration, and in the control of metabolic
pathways. Mitochondrial pathway information compris-
ing of pathways, enzymes involved, and their respective
KEGG Orthology was collected from KEGG http://www.
genome.jp/kegg/[27]. The pathway information can be
used to perform flux balance analyses to estimate the
metabolic capabilities of the mitochondria. Enzymes
were referenced to BRENDA http://www.brenda-
enzymes.info/[28].
Utility and discussion
Web interface
MitoInteractome is accessible through a web interface
that is powered by PHP and JavaScript. The data is stored
in retrievable MySQL tables.
As shown in Figure 3, the MitoInteractome can be
queried, using primary identification number/accession
number (from SwissProt), protein name/non-synon-
ymous SNP positions, and disease names. The facility
to limit the interacting partners to human proteins is
available. The sequences stored in the database can be
searched for high similarity matches using BLAST, which
is built into the website. The summary of search results
shows the following: interacting partners, SNPs within
proteins, the number of SNPs, disease related proteins,
gravy scores, physicochemical properties, pathway infor-
mation, and cross-references to external databases. For a
search performed using a disease name, MitoInteractome
provides detailed disease information with associated
variations (Figure 4).
We developed a Java based network viewer to graphically
visualize protein-protein interactions (Figure 5). Infor-
mation on the construction of MitoInteractome and
algorithms used are available on the supplement page of
the website. Interaction information is available for
download in tab-deliminated format, Cytoscape SIF
format, and PSI MI 2.5 format from the download
page http://mitointeractome.kobic.kr/downloads.php.
The help page explains the function of every search
interface.

‘Aging network’ - construction and analysis
The process of ‘aging’ is one of the active fields of
biological research, the study of the biological process
aspect of which is popular as ‘Biogerentology’.Itis
common knowledge that the onset of several neurode-
generative disorders such as Alzheimer’sdisease,Parkin-
son’s disease, Leigh’s syndrome etc. are of progressive
nature with aging. Several studies in the past have
indicated association of the aging process with mito-
chondria [29-31]. Since functioning of the mitochondria
is dependent on the number of its constituent compo-
nents, it is highly likely that a complex network of
interacting proteins is involved in the aging process.
Although previous studies have pointed towards indivi-
dual proteins associated with the aging process, interac-
tions among them have not been investigated.
A list of 42 distinct proteins associated with the ‘aging’
process was obtained from the GO database [32]. These
proteins were queried against MitoInteractome to find
the probable interacting partners of the proteins asso-
ciated with aging. The network constructed had 2,527
nodes (proteins) and 5,356 edges (interactions). The
plot of the node degree distribution is shown in Figure 6.
Nodes were assigned weights based on the uniqueness of
its representative protein across 102 eukaryotes that were
collected from KEGG. Every protein was decomposed
into its constituent PFAM [33] domains and the
conservation of the combination of domains was scored
on a scale of 0 - 1. The proteins that had the least
conserved domains, and hence were unique to this
network, were weighted as 1, while proteins that were
most conserved were weighted as 0. The network is
illustrated in Figure 7.
A centrality measure - "Strength of a node" - was
introduced, which is defined as the sum of the weights
of other nodes it is interacting with. Strength for a
weighted network is analogous to ‘Connectivity’ for an
un-weighted network. Strength of a node in the present
network would capture the size of its neighborhood,
constituted by the interacting proteins, as well as the
uniqueness of the neighborhood, derived from the

domain conservation analysis. Proteins possessing
higher strengths (e.g Gene name: GRB2, ABL1, TP53,
ANDE1) were observed to be involved in at least one
aging related disease, while proteins (e.g. Gene name:
ACTB, HNRNPA3, EIF4H) that had low strengths were
observed to be mostly house-keeping gene products.
GRB2 is known to be involved in embryonic develop-
ment and malignant transformation [34]. Due to its
involvement as a signal transducer in pathways, includ-
ing pathways and genes previously related to aging such
as INS/IGF1 signalling and SHC1 [35], it is probable that
GRB2 plays a vital role in ageing. GRB2 was observed to
have the highest strength of 75.76.
ABL1 plays an important role in cellular proliferation
and development [36]. They are activated by oxidative
stress and are related to aging and tumorigenesis. It was
found that disruption of ABL1 in mice results in several
defects and leads to death shortly after birth [37]. It is
present among the central proteins of the aging network
with a strength of 46.16.
It has previously been reported that the p53 protein
(encoded by TP53 gene) plays an important role in
aging. Matheu et al. [38] showed that genetically
modified mice with increased levels of p53 have
decreased levels of aging associated damage. In the
aging network constructed the p53 protein was observed
to have a high strength of 45.97. The TP53 gene acts as a
tumor suppressor and also induces apoptosis depending
on the physiological circumstances.
E1 is ATP dependent DNA helicase required for initiation
of viral DNA replication and are involved in almost all
aspect of nucleic acid metabolism including replication,
repair, recombination, transcription, translation and
ribosome biogenesis. Defects in helicase gene have
been reported to be responsible for variety of human
genetic disorders which can lead to cancer, premature

aging or mental disorders. It can be inferred that E1,
which has a strength of 42.05, might be significant to the
aging network [39].
Other strong proteins and their associated functions are
listed in Table 1. From the observations made in the
‘aging network’ analysis, it is reasonable to conjecture
that proteins having high strengths in the analyzed
network are the key players in aging network and could
influence the longevity of the organism.
Conclusion
MitoInteractome is a comprehensive database containing
the following information on proteins in mitochondria:
physico-chemical properties, predicted interaction partners,
polymorphism and their effects, diseases and pathways
involved.Thedatabasehasbeencrossreferencedtoexternal
databasewherenecessary.Thederivedinformationstoredin
MitoInteractome would serve as a precursor for the
construction and analysis of protein networks.
The construction and analysis of ‘aging network’
presented in this work as a case-study provided us with
insights into interactions among the key entities
involved in the aging process. The same protocol can
be extended to construct similar interaction networks
and investigate other mitochondria centric processes
such as Apoptosis, Oxidative Phosphorylation.
