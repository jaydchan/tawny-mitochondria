Abstract
Mitochondria are central players in the determination of cell life and death. They are essential for
energy production, since most cellular ATP is produced in their matrix by the oxidative
phosphorylation pathway. At the same time, mitochondria are the main regulators of apoptotic cell
death, mediating both extrinsic (cell-surface receptor mediated) and intrinsic apoptotic pathways.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulate as side products of the electron transport chain,
causing mitochondrial damage. Non-functional mitochondria accumulate in aged individuals, and
cell homeostasis is maintained by removing damaged mitochondria by an autophagic process
called “mitophagy”. In addition, mitochondrial ROS represent signaling molecules leading to
autophagy, consisting in the bulk degradation of cytosolic portions. When cell homeostasis is
perturbed, and cytosolic components are damaged, autophagy represents a defense mechanism
aimed at removing non functional proteins and organelles. If this is not sufficient, cell death
occurs with distinct morphological hallmarks from apoptosis. This binary choice integrates a
number of critical information converging on a number of common regulatory elements. In this
review, the focus will be placed on the central role of mitochondria in the cross-talk between
autophagy and apoptosis, highlighting the signaling pathways and molecular machinery impinging
on these organelles.
Mitochondria and Aging
During aging, a general decline in cellular function occurs, due to accumulation of damaged
macromolecules and organelles which are not readily removed. Targeted deletion of specific
genes has demonstrated that multiple components of the Igf-1/insulin signalling pathway
play a role in the aging process spanning from nematodes to rodents (Bartke, 2008). Caloric
restriction is the only non-genetic mechanism known to extend lifespan, most likely
activating multiple mechanisms (Canto and Auwerx, 2009). Back in 1956, Herman proposed
a theory of aging according to which damage caused by ROS leads to senescence (Harman,
1956). He hypothesized that the introduction of anti-oxidant agents in the diet would
prolong life span as a result of reduced oxidative damage to key cellular components. By
feeding different mouse strains with various anti-oxidant agents, he could demonstrate the
validity of his revolutionary idea (Harman, 1972). Since then, a great amount of work,
described in exhaustive reviews (Beckman and Ames, 1998), has been done to unravel the
role of ROS in aging.

Since ROS are generated mainly as by-products of mitochondria respiration it appears
evident that mitochondria play a fundamental role in aging and represent putative targets of
anti-aging strategies. Nevertheless, the relationship between ROS-induced damage,
mitochondria function and involved regulators, and aging is far to be clarified. In
mitochondria ROS cause mutations of mtDNA which affect the electron transport chain
function triggering increased ROS generation and accumulation of mtDNA damage over
time. Whether this process affects the decrease in respiration function observed in aging is
still matter of debate (Chan, 2006). Indeed, animal models depleted for the proofreading
function of DNA-polimerase-γ (POLG) show increase in mtDNA mutations, classical sign
of aging and reduced life span (Kujoth et al., 2005; Trifunovic et al., 2004). However, no
increase in hydrogen peroxide and in oxidized macromolecules was detected in these mice,
in contrast with the putative direct interconnection between ROS production, mtDNA
mutations, and respiration. Moreover, mtDNA mutations affect only a proportion of
senescence cells, suggesting that age-related mitochondria dysfunction only partially
develop by mtDNA mutations. Caloric restriction extends life span in many organisms but,
in contrast to what one could imagine at a first glance, reducing food intake does not lower
respiration rate but rather it increases mitochondria function, and this opens a number of
unanswered questions on the physiological role of such response (Guarente, 2008). What is
clear is that during aging, together with aberrant macromolecules, giant non-functional
mitochondria, defective in ATP production, accumulate especially in post-mitotic organs,
such as the nervous system and the cardiac and skeletal muscle. Moreover, defects in
autophagy are detected in age-related disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases and
sarcopenia (Levine and Kroemer, 2008). Indeed a general decline of autophagy accompanies
aging (Bergamini et al., 2007) and strategies that prolong life-span, such as caloric
restriction, imply induction of autophagy. On the other side, overexpression of autophagy
genes, for example Atg8, in drosophila brain, greatly prolongs life-span (Simonsen et al.,
2008). The fundamental role of autophagy is demonstrated by experiments in nematodes, in
which the life-span extension effect of single gene mutations (such as the Insulin/Igf-1
receptor DAF-2 or TOR) or of caloric restriction require the expression of autophagy genes
(Hansen et al., 2008; Melendez et al., 2003).
Mitophagy
Autophagy consists in the bulk degradation of cytosolic portions that is active in various
conditions either at basal or induced level. The engulfed cytosolic content is surrounded by a
double-membrane structure (the autophagosome) and delivered to the lysosome where it is
degraded by lysosomal proteases.
Autophagy permits clearance of misfolded proteins and non functional organelles, that
accumulate especially in post-mitotic cells such as those of the nervous system and of
skeletal muscle, thus delaying aging of those tissues; autophagy is induced during fasting, in
order to provide aminoacids which can be used by the liver for gluconeogenesis. It is also
active during development, in immune responses and in tumor suppression.
Mitochondria are both the major source of intracellular ROS and, at the same time, targets of
ROS. Damaged mitochondria are degraded by a specialized form of autophagy called
mitophagy (Figure 1), ensuring the maintenance of a functional mitochondria population.
During aging autophagy declines and aberrant mitochondria accumulate. Increasing
autophagic activity in the elderly may thus be beneficial in that it contributes to the
maintenance of a functional mitochondria population. Whether autophagy is a nonspecific
degradation process, or rather some proteins or organelles may be specifically targeted for
autophagic degradation is still debated. Growing evidence suggests that a certain level of

specificity is achieved, and mitochondria represent privileged targets when their degradation
is required, both in physiological and in pathological conditions.
In yeast, protein localized in mitochondria, such as Uth1p (Kissova et al., 2004) and Aup1p
(Tal et al., 2007), are required for efficient mitophagy. In mammalian cells, initial studies
suggested that serum withdrawal promotes autophagic degradation preferentially of those
mitochondria carrying mtDNA mutations (Gu et al., 2004). Direct evidence that damaged
mitochondria are removed by autophagy in mammalian cells came from experiments based
on starvation and laser-induced photodamage of hepatocytes mitochondria (Kim et al.,
2007). In these experiments, hepatocytes of GFP-LC3 transgenic mice were loaded with
TMRM, a positively charged fluorescent dye which accumulates in the mitochondria matrix
down the membrane potential generated across the inner mitochondrial membrane by the
respiratory chain (Δψm). After nutrient deprivation a fraction of the mitochondria population
was sequestered in GFP-LC3 positive vesicles. After sequestration, mitochondria lost their
TMRM fluorescence, indicating that depolarization occurred. In a second experiment, after
exposure to a laser light, mitochondria lost again their membrane potential. Also in this case
damaged mitochondria were eventually sequestered in GFP-LC3-labeled autophagosomes
(Kim et al., 2007).
A physiological example of mitophagy is given by the maturation process of reticulocytes.
During this event, mitochondria are completed eliminated by autophagy-dependent and
independent pathways (Zhang et al., 2009). As described in the “common players” section,
BH3-only proteins, such as Binp3 and Nix (Bnip3L), induce autophagy by releasing
Beclin-1 from its interaction with members of the Bcl2 family. The autophagic degradation
of reticulocytes mitochondria requires Nix (Bnip3L), since mitochondria autophagy is
defective in Nix −/− reticulocytes (Schweers et al., 2007). Nix-dependent collapse of the
Δψm appears to be an essential event for erythroid mitophagy and maturation (Sandoval et
al., 2008). Moreover, Nix is specifically required for mitophagy, since ribosomes were
normally eliminated in the absence of Nix (Sandoval et al., 2008). Erythroid maturation is
also regulated by the serine threonine kinase Ulk1, the mammalian homolog of yeast atg1p,
which, in complex with Atg13, is responsible for autophagosome formation regulated by
mTOR activity. In contrast to Nix, Ulk1 regulates clearance of both ribosomes and
mitochondria during this process (Kundu et al., 2008). Remarkably, an Atg5/Atg7-
independent macroautophagy system has been identified, which partially accounts for
mitochondrial removal during erythrocyte maturation (Nishida et al., 2009; Zhang et al.,
2009).
Removal of aberrant mitochondria has been shown to play a protective role in age-related
neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson disease. Specifically, the ubiquitin-ligase
Parkin, the loss-of-function of which causes Parkinson's disease, is involved. Parkin is
selectively recruited to dysfunctional mitochondria with low membrane potential in
mammalian cells and causes their autophagy-mediated degradation (Narendra et al., 2008),
suggesting that Parkinson's disease may be at least in part associated with failure to
eliminate dysfunctional mitochondria. The translocation of Parkin to mitochondria requires
PINK1, which is a protein kinase, ubiquitously expressed in the human brain, and localized
to the intermembrane space, as well as in membranes of the mitochondria. At the
mitochondria, Parkin and PINK1 are localized in close proximity, but no evidence of mutual
post-trascriptional regulation was found (i.e. phosphorylation of Parkin by PINK1 or
ubiquitination of PINK1 by Parkin). However, co-expression of Parkin and PINK1 caused
formation of mitochondrial aggregates surrounded by autophagic vacuoles (Vives-Bauza et
al., 2009), suggesting that impairment of mitochondria turnover by either Parkin or PINK1
mutations may cause accumulation of defective mitochondria and neurodegeneration in
Parkinson's disease. In a different setup, represented by SH-SY5Y cell line, loss of PINK1

elevated superoxide production, induced mitochondria fragmentation, Δψm collapse,
autophagy and mitophagy (Dagda et al., 2009). Activation of mitochondria fission and
increased mitochondrial oxidant production were required for autophagy in PINK1-deficient
cells. Moreover, overexpression of Parkin enhanced the mitophagy response. Thus, PINK1
appears to play an important role for the maintenance of mitochondrial networks which,
together with Parkin-induced mitophagy, may serve to reduce toxicity associated with
dysfunctional mitochondria in PD. Indeed, morphological changes of the mitochondrial
network occur continuously and regulate mitochondrial and cellular functions. By tracking
photolabeled mitochondria, it has been shown that fission and fusion events permit the
segregation of dysfunctional mitochondria which are eventually degraded by autophagy
(Twig et al., 2008). Work on the pro-fission protein Fis1 demonstrates that fission events
trigger autophagy per se, but only when associated with mitochondrial dysfunction (Gomes
and Scorrano, 2008).
Even if there is now evidence for selective autophagy-dependent degradation of
mitochondria, the mechanism of mitochondrial selection has been started to be elucidated
only very recently thanks to studies carried in budding yeast. A first indication came from
the recognition that the cargo adaptor protein Atg11 is essential for mitophagy (Kanki and
Klionsky, 2008). A mitochondria-anchored receptor, Atg32, which confers selectivity during
mitophagy was subsequently identified (Kanki et al., 2009; Okamoto et al., 2009). Atg32
does not have homologues in higher eukaryotes, leaving open the question of how
selectivity is reached in other species.
Mitochondrial ROS in the regulation of autophagy and apoptosis
Excessive ROS production represents a death threat for the cell, which reacts to this insult
by activating defence mechanisms, including autophagy. ROS act as signalling molecules in
the early events of autophagy induction. If the pro-survival attempt fails, ROS cause cell
death which, depending on the experimental context, involves either the autophagic or the
apoptotic pathway, or both (Figure 1). Whether autophagy activation can cause death per se
in physiological conditions is still matter of debate (Kroemer and Levine, 2008).
Signaling pathways mediated by ROS play a role in physiological situations in which
autophagy is induced. Indeed, during starvation mitochondrial ROS production is enhanced
and autophagy increased (Scherz-Shouval et al., 2007). ROS production is essential for
autophagy induction, as treatment with antioxidant agents abolishes autophagosome
formation upon starvation, and the effect of ROS is partially PI3K dependent. The authors
suggested that upon starvation, ROS, and in particular H2O2, oxidize and inhibit Atg4,
which is a protease responsible for LC3 de-lipidation promoting autophagosome maturation
(Scherz-Shouval et al., 2007). In this case no sign of programmed cell death was observed,
in agreement with the well known pro-survival function of starvation-induced autophagy.
In a different setup, ROS-induced autophagy was linked to cell death, rather than survival.
This effect was observed specifically in cancer cell, in which the role of autophagy is still
debated. Indeed, whether autophagy represents a tumor suppressor mechanism (by removing
aberrant mitochondria, therefore lowering ROS production and genome instability) (see
below) or rather promotes tumorigenesis (exerting a protective role on cancer cells), is not
clear, and most likely is context-dependent. Autophagy-dependent death was observed in
cancer cell lines treated with inhibitors of complex I and II of the mitochondrial electron
transport chain (rotenone and TTFA respectively). These cells displayed increased ROS
production, cell death and autophagy (Chen et al., 2007). Cell death was decreased by
treatment with siRNA against autophagy genes or with the autophagy inhibitor 3-

methyladenine (3-MA). Moreover, autophagy and cell death were decreased when the ROS
scavenger tiron was added to rotenone or TTFA treated cells.
The dual role of ROS to induce either apoptosis or autophagy depends on the cell context
and on specific modulators of ROS activity. One of these factors is TIGAR, which is a p53-
target gene. Similarly to other proteins involved in DNA damage repair, the tumor-
suppressor p53 plays an essential role in life span determination and has been implicated in
the regulation of the senescence process (reviewed in (Rodier et al., 2007)). Its target gene
TIGAR contributes to the regulation of intracellular ROS levels by modulation of the
glycolytic pathway (Bensaad et al., 2006). By decreasing glycolytic rate and redirecting
glycolytic intermediates to the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway, TIGAR
causes an increase in NADPH production, which contributes to the scavenging of ROS by
reduced glutathione. In this manner, TIGAR lower the sensitivity of cells to p53-dependent
apoptosis induced by oxidative stress (Bensaad et al., 2006). At the same time, TIGAR
inhibits autophagy induced by nutrient starvation and metabolic stress, independently of
mTOR or p53 modulation (Bensaad et al., 2009).
The patho-physiological importance of ROS production and autophagy induction was
studied in skeletal muscle. Muscle atrophy is a hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS) and is associated to increased oxidative stress. However, whether oxidative stress
triggers muscle atrophy per se, or it is a consequence of muscle atrophy was not clear. In
order to answer this question and to dissect the pathways involved, Musarò and colleagues
developed a mouse model in which expression of mutated superoxide dismutase 1
(SOD1G93A) was restricted to skeletal muscle (Dobrowolny et al., 2008). Accumulation of
oxidative stress in the muscles of these mice triggered progressive atrophy associated to
increased autophagy and FoxO3 expression, a transcription factor which is required for the
induction of autophagy in skeletal muscle (Mammucari et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2007).
The consequences of ROS-mediated damage due to lack of active autophagy are evident in
the liver. Liver-specific autophagy-deficient mice display liver dysfunction, in particular
hepatomegaly with concomitant accumulation of ubiquitin-positive aggregates (Komatsu et
al., 2005). Proteomic analysis of autophagy-deficient liver demonstrates that autophagy is
required to reduce oxidative stress, and hence cellular damage (Matsumoto et al., 2008).
Such analysis showed that, although autophagy impairment leads to a general increase in
total protein mass with no changes in overall protein composition, a series of oxidative
stress-inducible proteins, including glutathione S-transferase families, protein disulfide
isomerase and glucose regulated proteins, were specifically increased in autophagy-deficient
liver (Matsumoto et al., 2008). Interestingly, the nuclear levels of the transcription factor
Nrf2, which translocates to the nucleus in response to oxidative stress and activates the
transcription of various detoxifying enzymes, were increased in autophagy-deficient liver
(Komatsu et al., 2007). p62/SQSTM1 is an adaptor protein which binds LC3 and
polyubiquitinated proteins to form inclusion bodies which are degraded by autophagy and
that accumulate when autophagy in inhibited (Bjorkoy et al., 2005; Pankiv et al., 2007).
Loss of p62 suppresses inclusion formation in autophagy-deficient hepatocytes. Moreover
induction of detoxifying enzymes and NRF2 nuclear translocation in autophagy-deficient
liver were suppressed by loss of p62 (Komatsu et al., 2007). Altogether these results indicate
that autophagy deficiency causes liver dysfunction and cell stress, with concomitant p62-
dependent Nrf2 activation (Komatsu et al., 2007).
A similar link among autophagy, p62 and oxidative stress has been identified in tumor cells
(Mathew et al., 2009). p62 accumulation in autophagy-deficient tumor cells upon metabolic
stress is sufficient to cause accumulation of damaged mitochondria, elevated oxidative stress
and DNA damage response. Such effects are suppressed by knockdown of p62, indicating
Mammucari and Rizzuto Page 5

that elevated oxidative stress is due directly to p62 accumulation. Thus p62 contributes
directly to tumor growth when autophagy is inhibited (Mathew et al., 2009).
Control of life and death by mitochondrial calcium pathways
Mitochondria are essential mediators of apoptotic stimuli, playing a fundamental role in the
execution of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways. The vastness of the literature in
the field is such that a reasonable comment of it is beyond the scope of this review.
Thus, here we will focus on the role of signalling mediated by the second messenger Ca2+
in the regulation of apoptosis and on recent data on the role of p66shc in mediating the
response of mitochondria to ROS-induced apoptosis. Next we will briefly summarize data
linking mitochondrial calcium regulation to longevity in a model of Leigh syndrome, a
mitochondrial disease associated with cytochrome c oxidase deficiency.
Changes in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration are observed in many circumstances. Cellular
Ca2+ overload represents a threat for cell life, since many proteases and phospholipases are
activated by Ca2+ and can lead to necrotic cell death. This is not the only effect of changes
in cytosolic Ca2+. Indeed apoptotic cell death relies on increased Ca2+ concentrations
(Murgia et al., 2009), mediated both by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium release and by
capacitative Ca2+ influx through Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ channels (Pinton and
Rizzuto, 2006). Depending on the range of the insult, and consequently on the amount of
Ca2+ increase, either necrosis or apoptosis is activated. Within the cell Ca2+ can establish
local concentrations, due to its low rate of diffusion in comparison with other second
messengers, and the dynamic sequestration of this ion by several organelles (Rizzuto and
Pozzan, 2006). This unique property permits the cell to decipher various signals triggering
different outcomes through a single molecule. ER plays a fundamental role in the regulation
of calcium concentration and in the sensitivity to apoptosis. Ca2+ accumulated in the ER can
be released upon apoptotic stimuli coupled to IP3, and being detected by mitochondria.
Bcl-2 family proteins, strategically located at the ER and mitochondria surfaces, are
important regulator of this process. Bcl-2 overexpressing cells showed a significant
reduction in the Ca2+ levels within the ER and the Golgi apparatus. Consequently, reduced
Ca2+ concentration increases upon stimuli coupled to IP3 generation were detected both in
the cytosol and in the mitochondria (Pinton et al., 2000). The same effect was observed in
cells in which the pro-apoptotic members of Bcl-2 family, Bax and Bak were deleted
(Danial and Korsmeyer, 2004). At the same time, Bax and Bak double knockout cells are
protected against apoptotic stimuli (Scorrano et al., 2003). In these cells, silencing of Bcl-2
partially restored ER Ca2+ values to control levels (Danial and Korsmeyer, 2004).
Stimuli that induces cytosolic Ca2+ rise elicit large Ca2+ influxes in the mitochondria
matrix, despite the low affinity of mitochondrial Ca2+ transporters for this ion. This is
explained by the existence of mitochondria-ER contacts, where microdomains of high Ca2+
concentrations are present and trigger rapid accumulation of Ca2+ in the matrix (Hayashi et
al., 2009). Mitochondria Ca2+ uptake causes a variety of responses, from stimulation of
metabolism (ATP production) when they are subject to a transient stimuli, to apoptosis in
case of a more persistent or excessive Ca2+ increase. Moreover, mitochondria Ca2+
accumulation triggered by apoptotic stimuli causes swelling and fragmentation,
accompanied by cytochrome c release. Permeability transition pore (PTP) opening was also
observed upon ceramide-induced apoptosis, which sensitizes mitochondria to the otherwise
physiological IP3-mediated Ca2+ signal (Szalai et al., 1999) (Figure 1). As for ER calcium
concentrations, Bcl-2 family members control this apoptosic pathway. In particular Bax and
Bak localize at the outer mitochondria membrane upon apoptotic stimuli and trigger

mitochondria outer membrane permeabilization and release of apoptotic factors in the
cytosol (Danial and Korsmeyer, 2004).
Impairment of mitochondrial function caused by ROS-induced mtDNA damage, lipid
peroxidation or protein oxidation may also lead to apoptotic cell death. In this scenario, the
redox enzyme p66shc plays a fundamental role. Ablation of p66shc enhances cellular
resistance to apoptosis upon oxidative stress and life span extension (Migliaccio et al.,
1999). When exposed to oxidative conditions, p66shc is phosphorylated by PKCβ and
translocates to mitochondria after being recognized by the prolyl isomerase Pin1, where it
causes alterations of the mitochondrial calcium responses (Pinton et al., 2007). Moreover,
the mitochondrial fraction of p66shc behaves as redox enzyme that utilizes reducing
equivalents derived from the mitochondrial electron transport chain to produce H2O2 in the
intermembrane space (Giorgio et al., 2005). Alteration of mitochondrial three-dimensional
structure, calcium responses and ROS generation eventually lead to apoptosis (Giorgio et al.,
2005; Pinton et al., 2007) (Figure 1).
The role of mitochondrial calcium regulation in the determination of life span extension has
been explored in the context of a Leigh syndrome model, a lethal mitochondrial disorder
associated with COX decifiency. Mice in which one of the genes responsible for the disease,
Surf1, which encodes a putative COX assembly factor, was deleted, showed COX defect,
although milder then in humans (Dell'agnello et al., 2007). These mice did not show
spontaneous neurodegeneration, and were protected from Ca2+-dependent neurotoxicity
induced by exposure to kainic acid. Moreover, similarly to deletion of p66shc, Surf1
deficiency caused increased longevity in mice (Dell'agnello et al., 2007). The difference
between the effects of Surf1 deletion in human, where it is fatal in childhood, and mice may
be due to the difference in severity of COX deficiency. These results are anyway surprising
since absence of COX activity should cause increase of ROS and accelerated aging.
Common players
Autophagic and apoptotic responses to stress are intimately interconnected. A number of
different outcomes have been described, depending on the various experimental contexts.
When apoptosis is impaired, the cell may respond by activating autophagy and vice-versa.
However, in some circumstances, the physiological relevance of the observation made is not
obvious. Readers are referred to exhaustive reviews on the topic (e.g.(Maiuri et al., 2007b)),
while here we will focus on the description of regulatory elements that impinge on both
pathways at the mitochondrial level.
Bcl-2 family members
Proteins belonging to the Bcl-2 family are well known regulators of apoptosis. Bcl-2, Bcl-
XL and MCL-1 suppress apoptosis, while Bax, Bak and the BH3 only proteins are
proapototic factors. Their role in autophagy regulation emerged when Beclin 1, which is a
BH3-only protein (Oberstein et al., 2007) that interacts with Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, was
identified as an essential autophagy gene (Liang et al., 1999; Yue et al., 2003). Beclin 1 is a
haploinsufficient tumor-suppressor gene frequently deleted in breast, ovarian and prostate
cancer (Maiuri et al., 2009). It is part of a Class III PI3K dynamic multimeric complex that
participates in autophagosome formation (Kihara et al., 2001). Beclin 1 was found to
interact with Bcl-2 in yeast two hybrid screening (Liang et al., 1998). In such way Bcl-2, in
particular the Bcl-2 fraction localized at the ER, inhibits Beclin 1 dependent autophagy, thus
exerting a dual role of antiapoptotic and antiautophagic protein (Pattingre et al., 2005). This
binding may regulate autophagy levels and cell survival (Pattingre et al., 2005) and is
modulated by nutrient status. Beclin 1 contains a BH3 domain essential for its interaction
with the BH3 groove of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, and thus for its regulation (Sinha and Levine,
Mammucari and Rizzuto Page 7

2008). The regulation of this interaction and, consequently, of autophagy, can be explained
by two mechanisms. In the first case, starvation causes JNK1 activation, which leads to
phosphorylation of Bcl-2 and dissociation of Bcl-2 and Beclin 1 (Wei et al., 2008), and the
starvation-induced dissociation is abrogated in cells lacking JNK1 or in which JNK1 is
inhibited. The second mechanism involves the competitive binding of the BH3 domain of
Beclin 1 to BCl-2 by other BH3-containing proteins. BH3-only proteins such as Bnip3
(Zhang et al., 2008), Bad, EGL-1 and the BH3 domain peptidomimetic (Maiuri et al., 2007a)
induce autophagy by competitively disrupting the interaction between Beclin 1 and Bcl2 or
Bcl-XL. Moreover, other BH3 only proteins, such as Bik (Rashmi et al., 2008), Noxa and
Puma (Abedin et al., 2007) have been shown to induce autophagic cell death. The
mechanism for such induction may be similar to the one described for other BH3-only
proteins or, alternatively, may involve different effectors. For example, the BH3-only
protein Puma is a central mediator of p53-dependent apoptosis and functions by activating
Bax and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. In response to mitochondrial
perturbations Puma can also induce autophagy through Bax, leading to selective removal of
mitochondria, and this is not due to release of Beclin 1 from Bcl-2, since this event would
not be influenced by Bax or Bak expression (Yee et al., 2009). Moreover, inhibition of
autophagy diminishes Puma and Bax mediated apoptosis, suggesting that, at least in some
circumstances, selective autophagic targeting of mitochondria can enhance apoptosis (Yee et
al., 2009). For what concern their physiological relevance in the cross-talk between
apoptosis and autophagy induction, the best characterized BH3 only proteins are Bnip3 and
Bnip3L (Nix). Bnip3L is required for normal erythrocyte differentiation, as mentioned
earlier (Sandoval et al., 2008; Schweers et al., 2007), and both Bnip3L and Bnip3 play a role
in cellular responses to ischemia/reperfusion injury in the heart (Galvez et al., 2006;
Hamacher-Brady et al., 2007). Bnip3 levels are induced after stress such as hypoxia in a
HIF-1-dependent manner (Zhang et al., 2008) and consequently it localizes at the
mitochondria causing increase in ROS, opening of the permeability transition pore and loss
of mitochondrial membrane potential (Chen et al., 1999), leading to cell death, most likely
both via apoptosis and via autophagy. In cardiomyocytes, localization of Bnip3 at
mitochondria causes the release of cytochrome and caspase-dependent apoptosis (Regula et
al., 2002). Although the regulation of Bnip3 at mitochondria is unclear, Bax and Bak appear
to be downstream effectors of Bnip3-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction (Kubli et al.,
2007). In parallel to apoptosis, Bnip3 can also induce autophagy (Hamacher-Brady et al.,
2007; Mammucari et al., 2007; Tracy et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2008). In addition to the
mechanism reported earlier, involving differential interactions among Bnip3, Beclin 1 and
Bcl2 (Zhang et al., 2008), Bnip3 may induce autophagy by two other ways. In the first case
the damage that Bnip3 causes to mitochondria in cardiomyocytes as a result of ischemic
injury leads to induction of autophagy (Hamacher-Brady et al., 2007). In a different setting
Bnip3 has been found to block signalling by mTOR, which is a master regulator of
autophagy, through interaction with Rheb (Li et al., 2007). In the setting of heart failure,
Bnip3 expression is up-regulated during ischemia and is maintained elevated during
reperfusion in rat ventricular myocytes (Pitts et al., 2008), causing cell death and cardiac
remodelling (Diwan et al., 2007). How Bnip3 causes cell death in I/R injury is not
completely clear, and apoptosis, autophagy and necrosis could occur simultaneously.
Opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) seems to be an essential
event in Bnip3-mediated cell death (Vande Velde et al., 2000). In this respect, besides its
well known role in apoptosis, autophagy activation has been observed as a consequence of
PTP opening. For example, in cultured hepatocytes inhibition of the mitochondrial
permeability transition with CsA blocks both mitochondrial depolarization and the
proliferation of autophagosomes (Rodriguez-Enriquez et al., 2004).
Autophagic cell death has been described in the case of Bax/Bak double knockout
fibroblasts. These cell are resistant to apoptosis but they still undergo a non-apoptotic death

which is dependent on essential autophagy genes (Atg5 and Beclin 1), that was suppressed
by autophagy inhibitors, such as 3-methyl adenine, and that is modulated by Bcl-XL
(Shimizu et al., 2004). Thus autophagy appear to play not only a pro-survival, but also a pro-
death role, although in many cases this occurs when apoptosis is inhibited. Whether
autophagy plays a role in cell death is physiological condition in not completely clear.
Atg5 and calpain
Atg5 is an essential autophagy gene involved in the early stages of autophagosome
formation (Mizushima et al., 1998). Yousefi et al. demonstrated that Atg5 over-expression
sensitizes tumour cells to various apoptotic stimuli. When breast cancer cells expressing
increased levels of Atg5 were implanted in vivo, tumour growth was reduced and high levels
of apoptosis were observed. Apoptosis is favoured by calpain-mediated cleavage of Atg5,
which leads to an amino-terminal cleavage product. The cleaved form of Atg5 translocates
from the cytosol to the mitochondria where it associates to Bcl-xL and triggers cytochrome c
release and caspase activation (Yousefi et al., 2006), although it is not clear whether this
association, by releasing Bax from the inhibitory interaction with Bcl-xL, leads to Bax
activation.
Calpain not only triggers apoptosis, but appears to be essential for autophagy, too. Indeed, in
calpain-deficient cells autophagy is impaired and apoptotic cell death is highly increased and
CAPNS1-deficient cells are more sensitive to apoptosis induced by several autophagic
stimuli (Demarchi et al., 2006). From this results it appears clear that calpain plays a role in
the switch between autophagy and apoptosis, but its role in regulating these two processes is
not completely clear yet.
p53 pathway
The tumour-suppressor p53 plays a complex role in response to stresses, exerting both
nuclear and cytosolic functions. The transactivation and transcriptional repression functions
of p53 are well documented, and regulate the expression of genes involved in various
processes such as cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and others (Menendez et al., 2009). By
depleting stem cell pools, p53-induced cell cycle arrest can lead to aging phenotypes (Rodier
et al., 2007). In addition to this, p53 can trigger apoptosis independently of its transcriptional
activity (Caelles et al., 1994; Haupt et al., 1995; Kakudo et al., 2005). Indeed, upon various
cell-death stimuli p53 translocates to mitochondria where it causes mitochondrial outer
membrane permeabilization and consequent release of proapoptotic factors. p53 interacts
with Bcl2 family members and alternative interaction with anti- or pro-apoptotic proteins
may regulate its function at the mitochondrial surface (Speidel, 2009). At the same time, p53
regulates autophagy, both by transcriptional activation of target genes and by non-
transcriptional mechanisms. For example, DRAM (damage-regulated autophagy modulator)
is a p53 target genes which encodes a lysosomal protein. p53 induces autophagy in a DRAM
dependent manner. Moreover, DRAM is essential for p53-mediated apoptosis (Crighton et
al., 2006). Accordingly, autophagy was not induced by etoposide in p53−/− MEFs (Feng et
al., 2005). In a model of lymphoma in cells carrying inducible p53, activation of p53 causes
increased apoptotic cell death, while autophagy was activated in the surviving cells. Tumour
cell death was induced in p53 overexpressing cells when autophagy was inhibited
(Amaravadi et al., 2007).
Somehow surprisingly, Kroemer and co-workers found that autophagy is stimulated also in
the absence of p53 (Tasdemir et al., 2008), thus acting as an endogenous repressor of
autophagy. The cytosolic fraction of p53 is the one responsible for inhibition of autophagy.
In glucose starvation conditions, ATP levels are drastically reduced in wild type cells while,
in the absence of p53, ATP levels are maintained high. The resistance of p53 −/− cells to

metabolic stress is dependent on autophagy, since suppression of autophagy by depletion of
AMPKalpha or Beclin 1 reduced the capacity of p53−/− cells to maintain ATP levels during
starvation (Tasdemir et al., 2008). It is not clear which mechanism allows p53 to function
either as autophagy inhibitor or apoptosis inducer, but the two processes may be co-
ordinately regulated by cell death inducers.
The tumor suppressor ARF (murine p19ARF and human p14ARF) inhibits the p53 suppressor
Mdm2, thus causing activation of p53. A mitochondrial short form of p19ARF (smARF)
causes dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential in a p53- and Bcl2-independent
manner, eventually inducing autophagy and caspase-independent cell death, which was
blocked by knockdown of endogenous autophagic proteins, such as Atg5 and Beclin 1 (Reef
et al., 2006). In contrast, the nucleolar p19ARF was incapable of inducing p53-independent
autophagy (Reef and Kimchi, 2008), suggesting the existence of two different tumour
suppressor pathways activated by the two ARF isoforms. The first one relies on a rapid p53-
mediated nuclear response and the second one implicating mitochondrial-mediated
autophagy induction. smARF levels are controlled by its interaction with p32, a protein
predominantly localized to the mitochondrial matrix whose functions are not completely
clear yet. Suppression of p32 protein levels reduces smARF levels by increasing its turnover
and reduces the ability of ectopically expressed smARF to induce autophagy and
mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation. In contrast, the levels of nucleolar full-length
p19ARF were not affected by p32 depletion (Reef et al., 2007).
Conclusions
Age-related disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases, stroke, sarcopenia are propagating
in developed countries due to the exponentially increase in aged population. Trying to
combat aging, in the attempt not only to prolong life, but especially to preserve
physiological functions, represents an important strategy to ameliorate life quality. At the
cellular level, homeostasis is maintained when renewal of essential macromolecules is
warranted and organelles such as mitochondria are kept at maximum efficiency. Systems
such as the ubiquitin-proteasome and the autophagylysosome pathways are responsible for
the recognition and the degradation of non-functional cytosolic components. In the worst
case, apoptosis is activated. The cross-talk among these systems, two of which we have
analyzed here, is finely regulated. Future research will shed further light on how these
systems are regulated during senescence, with the aim of ensuring a healthy aging to the
future populations.

Figure 1. Signaling pathways regulating mitochondrial function
Mitochondria calcium uptake is tightly regulated and occurs at ER-mitochondria contacts
where microdomains of high calcium concentration are present. This event causes a variety
of responses depending on the amount of Ca2+ increase, from stimulation of metabolism
and ATP production to PTP opening and apoptosis. Mitochondria represent also the
privileged site of ROS production. ROS may act as signaling molecules, inducing a pro-
survival autophagic response, or may cause damage to cell components and apoptotic cell
death. ROS production is induced by oxidative stress, which activates a signaling cascade
involving the PKCβ-dependent phosphorylation of p66shc and its translocation to the
mitochondrial matrix. Mitochondria are also targets of ROS damage. Damaged
mitochondria are removed by mitophagy, a specialized form of autophagy, which is
regulated by different players, some of which are listed here.
