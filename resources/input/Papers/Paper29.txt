JCB: Comment
Ultrastructural and biochemical studies beginning in the 1950s 
demonstrated that mitochondria are degraded in the lysosome 
through a process called autophagy. Subsequent studies led to 
the identification of factors that promote autophagy, and demon-
strated that mitochondria are degraded in response to starvation 
or other cellular signals (Yang and Klionsky, 2010). However, 
until recently, the evidence in support of a mechanism by which 
damaged mitochondria can be selectively detected and degraded 
was largely nonexistent. Over the past two years, studies of the 
PINK1 and parkin genes, loss-of-function mutations of which 
give rise to heritable forms of Parkinson’s disease, have demon-
strated that these genes encode components of a mitochondrial 
quality control apparatus that promotes the selective turnover of 
damaged mitochondria (Whitworth and Pallanck, 2009; Jones, 
2010). These studies have led to a model in which PINK1, a 
mitochondrially localized serine/threonine kinase, accumulates 
selectively in depolarized mitochondria, where it recruits Par-
kin, a cytosolic E3 ubiquitin ligase. Parkin promotes the ubiqui-
tination of the mitochondrial fusion-promoting factor mitofusin 
and the destruction of the depolarized mitochondria through 
an autophagic mechanism (Fig. 1). Now, Tanaka et al. (see  
p. 1367 of this issue) extend our understanding of the PINK1–
Parkin mitochondrial quality control pathway by defining the 
role of mitofusin ubiquitination in this process. Furthermore, 
the authors demonstrate that the hexameric AAA-type ATPase 
p97 is required downstream of PINK1 and Parkin to promote 
the proteasomal turnover of ubiquitinated mitofusin and the 
autophagic removal of damaged mitochondria.
Although the finding that Parkin promotes the ubiqui-
tination of mitofusin was also recently reported in flies (Poole  
et al., 2010; Ziviani et al., 2010), the interpretation of this find-
ing was unclear. Ubiquitination of mitofusin might serve as a 
The PINK1–Parkin pathway plays a critical role in mito-
chondrial quality control by selectively targeting dam-
aged mitochondria for autophagy. In this issue, Tanaka 
et al. (2010. J. Cell Biol. doi: 10.1083/jcb.201007013) 
demonstrate that the AAA-type ATPase p97 acts down-
stream of PINK1 and Parkin to segregate fusion-incompetent 
mitochondria for turnover. p97 acts by targeting the mito-
chondrial fusion-promoting factor mitofusin for degra-
dation through an endoplasmic reticulum–associated 
degradation (ERAD)-like mechanism.

flag to target damaged mitochondria for autophagic turnover. 
Alternatively, or in addition, ubiquitin-mediated inactivation of 
mitofusin on damaged mitochondria after a fission event might 
serve to produce fusion-incompetent mitochondria that are pre-
vented from reentering the undamaged mitochondrial network. 
By treating cells briefly with the mitochondrial depolarizing 
agent CCCP in the presence and absence of Parkin, Tanaka et al. 
(2010) were able to show that after the removal of CCCP from 
the cell culture media, the fragmented mitochondrial population 
from Parkin-deficient cells reentered the mitochondrial network 
with significantly faster kinetics than the mitochondrial popula-
tion from Parkin-expressing cells. These investigators further 
showed that mitochondria in mouse embryonic fibroblasts that 
lack both of the known vertebrate mitofusins are still degraded 
in a Parkin-dependent fashion upon CCCP treatment. Together, 
these findings indicate that Parkin-mediated mitofusin ubiq-
uitination serves to prevent damaged mitochondria from re-
entering the undamaged mitochondrial network. Moreover, 
mitofusin ubiquitination does not represent a signal-triggering 
mitochondrial turnover. This study also showed that Parkin- 
mediated mitochondrial turnover was significantly attenuated  
in cells lacking the mitochondrial fission-promoting factor 
DRP1, which suggests that another possible role of mitofusin 
inactivation is to promote the formation of fragmented mito-
chondria that can be more efficiently degraded through autoph-
agy. Of potential relevance to these findings is recent work 
demonstrating that mitochondrial fission often yields asymmet-
ric products differing in membrane potential, with those fission 
products of lower membrane potential typically exhibiting a 
decreased probability of fusion and an increased probability of 
autophagy relative to their siblings (Twig et al., 2008).
Tanaka et al. (2010) have also advanced our understand-
ing of the mechanism of PINK1–Parkin-mediated mitofusin 
degradation by demonstrating that ubiquitinated mitofusin is 
degraded in a proteasome-dependent fashion through the aid of 
the AAA-ATPase p97. Although previous work indicates that 
p97 participates in a wide variety of cellular processes, includ-
ing SNARE-mediated fusion of homotypic membranes (Kondo 
et al., 1997), DNA replication (Deichsel et al., 2009), and autopha-
gosome maturation (Tresse et al., 2010), the role of p97 in the 
proteasomal turnover of ubiquitinated mitofusin is probably 
most relevant to its function in endoplasmic reticulum–associated

of depolarized mitochondria in cells that lack mitofusins sug-
gests that there are other substrates of Parkin that are important 
for the turnover event. The voltage-dependent anion channel 1  
(VDAC1) has previously been reported to be one of these sub-
strates (Geisler et al., 2010). However, a recent study using 
VDAC1 knockout cells indicated that VDAC1 is dispensable 
for Parkin-mediated mitochondrial turnover (Narendra et al., 
2010), which suggests that the Parkin substrates required to in-
duce mitochondrial turnover remain to be identified. Another 
question arising from the work of Tanaka et al. (2010) concerns 
the role of p97 in mitochondrial turnover. Although the authors 
convincingly show that p97 is required for both mitofusin and 
mitochondrial turnover, it is by no means clear that these roles 
of p97 are related: the requirement of p97 in mitochondrial 
turnover could pertain to the proteasomal turnover of another, 
unknown ubiquitinated mitochondrial protein, or to another 
activity of p97 altogether, such as its recently documented role 
in autophagosome maturation (Tresse et al., 2010). The find-
ing that p97-mediated mitofusin turnover is evolutionarily con-
served in yeast (Heo et al., 2010), which lacks obvious PINK1 
and Parkin orthologues, also raises the question of whether the 
factors that promote mitofusin ubiquitination in this organism 
constitute a PINK–Parkin-like mitochondrial quality control 
pathway. In addition to these new questions, there are several 
additional questions involving the PINK1–Parkin pathway that 
await explanation, including the mechanism by which PINK1 
degradation (ERAD). In this process, p97 is believed to assemble 
with polyubiquitinated ER proteins, in concert with p97-associated  
substrate-recruiting cofactors, to provide the driving force re-
quired to extrude the polyubiquitinated proteins from the ER 
membrane so that they can be degraded by the proteasome in 
the cytosol (Raasi and Wolf, 2007). Thus, the work of Tanaka 
et al. (2010) suggests that an ERAD-like mechanism also  
exists to degrade ubiquitinated mitochondrial proteins. This con-
clusion is further supported by closely related studies in yeast 
and vertibrate cell culture systems showing that p97 translo-
cates to mitochondria under stress to promote the proteasomal 
degradation of ubiquitinated mitochondrial targets, including 
mitofusin (Heo et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2010). Although only 
a very small number of mitochondrial proteins are currently 
known to be degraded in a proteasome-dependent fashion, all 
of these mitochondrial proteasomal substrates were revealed 
relatively recently (Margineantu et al., 2007; Azzu and Brand, 
2010; Livnat-Levanon and Glickman, 2010), so a more focused 
effort to identify additional such substrates might dramatically 
expand the list of mitochondrial p97/proteasomal targets.
Like many important advances, the work of Tanaka et al. 
(2010) also raises new questions. For example, the finding that 
mitofusins are dispensable for Parkin-mediated mitochondrial 
turnover still leaves open the possibility that the presence of mito-
fusins on damaged mitochondria inhibits mitochondrial turn-
over. Moreover, the finding that Parkin promotes the turnover  
Figure 1. The PINK1–Parkin mitochondrial quality control pathway. PINK1 is targeted to the mitochondrial outer membrane and is cleaved in a mito-
chondrial membrane potential–dependent fashion. Mitochondrial damage (red stars) followed by fission segregates a damaged/depolarized product. 
Inactivation of PINK1 cleavage in the damaged/depolarized fission product leads to an accumulation of PINK1 and the recruitment of Parkin. Parkin then 
ubiquitinates (Ub) mitofusin, which in turn leads to the assembly of p97 on ubiquitinated mitofusin and the subsequent extraction and proteasomal degra-
dation of mitofusin. The damaged/depolarized mitochondrion, which now lacks mitofusin, is unable to fuse with undamaged mitochondria and is instead 
targeted for autophagy in a p97-dependent process.

Given the many powerful model systems in play to address these 
questions and the rapid pace of progress on the PINK1–Parkin 
pathway over the past two years, it seems likely that answers to 
these and other questions will be forthcoming shortly.
