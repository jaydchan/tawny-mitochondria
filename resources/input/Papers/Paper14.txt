Great attention has recently been paid to the interaction
between the ER and mitochondria. The physical inter-
action between the ER and mitochondria is referred to
as the mitochondria-associated ER membrane (MAM).
This association has pivotal roles in several cellular func-
tions, including Ca
2+
signaling, lipid transport, energy
metabolism and cellular survival [5–8]. Recent studies
have unveiled the structural configuration of the interface
membranes of these two organelles [11,12]. Although the
cytoskeletonisimportantforshapingandsupportingorga-
nelles, the ER–mitochondria association is apparently
stable even when the integrity of microtubules and inter-
mediate filaments was disrupted [9,10]. The association is,
however, sensitive to Ca
2+
[11,13]. In living cells, some ER
membranes are often seen migrating with highly mobile
mitochondria [11,12,14].
Tethering of the two organelle membranes at an appro-
priate distance might affect mitochondrial function. For
example, a close distance (<5 nm as revealed by electron
tomography) between the ER and mitochondria promotes

The physical association between the endoplasmic reti-
culum (ER) and mitochondria, which is known as the
mitochondria-associated ER membrane (MAM), has
important roles in various cellular ‘housekeeping’ func-
tions including the non-vesicular transports of phospho-
lipids. It has recently become clear that the MAM also
enables highly efficient transmission of Ca
2+
from the ER
to mitochondria to stimulate oxidative metabolism and,
conversely, might enable the metabolically energized
mitochondria to regulate the ER Ca
2+
homeostasis.
Recent studies have shed light on molecular chaperones
such as calnexin, calreticulin, ERp44, ERp57, grp75 and
the sigma-1 receptor at the MAM, which regulate the
association between the two organelles. The MAM thus
integrates signal transduction with metabolic pathways
to regulate the communication and functional inter-
actions between the ER and mitochondrion.

even shorter (e.g. 10–25 nm) [11]. This distance thus
enables ER proteins to associate directly with proteins
and lipids of the OMM. This study also showed that the
ER membrane and the mitochondrial membrane are teth-
ered by trypsin-sensitive filaments seemingly composed of
proteins [11]. Importantly, knockdown of inositol-1,4,5-tri-

The most important functions of the MAM include lipid
transport and control of apoptosis but, here, we highlight

light of the characterization of the chaperones now known
to be crucial to the ER–mitochondrial interaction.
The mitochondria-associated ER membrane
Morphological evidence for the physical association or
interaction between the ER and mitochondria emerged
in the early 1990s, although the concept arose in the
1960s. Such contact has since been observed in mitochon-
driainmanytypesofcell[9,10].However,itisimportantto

MAM mainly involve local Ca
2+
transfer from ER to mito-
chondria and lipid shuttling via non-vesicular transport.
Though seemingly independent, Ca
2+
signaling and lipid
metabolism atthe MAM are,however,functionallyrelated.
The metabolically energized mitochondria via supplies of
pyruvateormalatecanregulatethereleaseofCa

ER [22]. Whether the MAM is involved in this regard is
unknown at present.
The MAM is also involved in apoptosis. Fas-signaling-
induced apoptosis involves the increase of IP3 production,
viatheactivationofphospholipaseC-g1,andthesubsequent
enhanced Ca
2+
release from IP3 receptors [23]. Blocking of
either segments of the signaling was cytoprotective [23].

at the MAM and that the rate-limiting step in PtdEtn synthesis is the
transport of PtdSer from MAM to mitochondria [54]. The transport is
not vesicular in nature [52] and does not require ATP. These findings
identified unique routes of intermembrane transports for phospho-
lipids in the cell.
The MAM, when visualized with MAM-specific protein sigma-1
receptors by using the immunodetection or GFP-labeling technique,
which was further verified by the MAM-specific fractionation [12],is
exceptionally enriched in cholesterol and neutral lipids [55,56].
Because the ACAT is highly enriched at the MAM, the MAM might
serve as a site for cholesterol and neutral lipid synthesis. No data are
available to indicate whether sterols or neutral lipids use the MAM as
routes for transport.
Nevertheless, steroidogenesis substantially depends on sterols
being shuttled between ER and mitochondria. For example,
cholesterol, after its synthesis at the ER following >15 steps of
enzymatic reactions, is transported to mitochondria for one single
enzymatic reaction to become pregnenolone [57]. Pregnenolone is
then back transported to the ER for the syntheses of several other
steroids [57].
The MAM might also serve as transport routes for ceramides from
the ER into mitochondria. It is interesting to note that an early study
using fluorophore (NBD)-conjugated ceramide indicated the energy-
independent transport of exogenously applied ceramides into
mitochondria [58]. When NBD-ceramides were applied to living
cells at 2 8C, under which vesicular transport mechanisms are shut
down, the NBD fluorescence accumulated first at the ER and then at
the mitochondria [58]. These findings illustrate the intermembrane
transport of ceramides at both the ER–mitochondrion interface and
the ER–plasma membrane interface.

The MAM is vital for regulating Ca

levels in mito-
chondria. Mitochondrial Ca

has several roles, but Ca

-

in the past decade. Mitochondrial Ca
2+
levels are import-
ant for cellular bioenergetics because the enzymes in the
tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the electron transport
chain depend on Ca
2+
to generate the high-energy com-
pound ATP. Three key enzymes of the TCA cycle, which
takes place in the lumen and the inner mitochondrion
membrane (IMM), are Ca
2+
-dependent [15]. Pyruvate
dehydrogenase is activated by Ca
2+
-dependent depho-
sphorylation, whereas a-ketoglutarate and isocitrate
dehydrogenases are directly activated by Ca
2+
[7,16].
The supply of Ca
2+
to mitochondria is crucial for matching
the ATP production by the TCA cycle with the ATP
demand. Thus, upon the activation of a wide range of
hormone and neurotransmitter receptors, the IP3 gener-

interesting characteristic of the Ca

-regulated mitochon-
drial bioenergetics is the so-called ‘long-term metabolic
priming’, in which the ATP production from pyruvate or
lactate is greater in IP3-primed cells compared with con-
trols [17]. In other words, the production of ATP from
pyruvate or lactate is enhanced in cells previously exposed
to a priming dose of IP3. Therefore, a transient but suffi-
cient rise of mitochondrial matrix Ca
2+
concentration via
an activation of IP3 receptors has a role in the responsive-
ness of mitochondrial metabolism.
Several other proteins regulated by mitochondrial Ca
2+
have been identified. For example, the accumulation of
mitochondrial Ca

activates the manganese superoxide
dismutase (MnSOD) by promoting its dephosphorylation
[18]. Interestingly, metabolite transport is also regulated

The lipid transport function of the MAM has been well
characterized (briefly described in Box 1). The MAM has
since been shown to be enriched in functionally diverse
enzymes involved not only in lipid metabolism but also
glucosemetabolism.Collectively,theenzymesincludephos-
phatidylserine (PtdSer) synthase, phosphatidylethanola-
mine (PtdEtn) methyltransferase-2, acyl-CoA:cholesterol

Box 1. Lipid transport at the MAM
Concepts of membrane contacts between ER and mitochondria first
emerged from lipid research back in the 1960s. The most important
pathways of the de novo phospholipid biosynthesis are: (i) the
synthesis of PtdSer from serine by the PtdSer synthase; (ii)
decarboxylation of PtdSer by PtdSer decarboxylase for synthesis of
PtdEtn; and (iii) methylation of PtdEtn by PtdEtn N-methyltransferase
for synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PtdChol) [6]. In early 1980s, it
was shown that PtdEtn is synthesized in mitochondria. However, the
intracellular localization of PtdSer synthase was controversial: the
enzymatic activity was detected in both microsomal and crude
mitochondrial membranes. The translocation and the subsequent
decarboxylation of PtdSer can be achieved by simply adding
microsomes to purified mitochondria [52]. Vance and co-workers

however, is expelledby antiporters in a process exchanging
for either Na

membrane potential and the Ca

concentration in mito-
chondria[7,16].However,theaminoacidsequenceofeither

The importance of the MAM began to emerge when it
was found that, after the agonist stimulation to the cell,
mitochondria were able to uptake Ca
2+
into their lumen
directlyfromIP3receptorsattheMAM[24–26].IP3serves
as the second messenger to the stimulation of agonists and
is known to release Ca
2+
from the ER by binding to IP3
receptors, which are Ca
2+
channels on the ER membrane
[26–29]. The most important Ca

transporters and chan-
nels at the MAM are depicted in Figure 1.

thought to be important for the Na

activated by pathological conditions, increases the permeability of IMM to small
ions and molecules, leading to a collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential
as well as the membrane architecture. The ryanodine receptor is similar to the IP3

mechanisms. Abbreviations: Ca

hydrolysis of ATP as the energy source. The depletion of
ATP thus inactivates PtdSer synthase. The synthase
activity, however, can be restored by adding millimolar
concentrations of Ca
2+
to microsomes [30]. The activity of
IP3 receptors at the MAM, which efflux ER Ca
2+
into
mitochondria,mightthusalsoaffecttheenzymaticactivity
of the PtdSer synthase because of the ensued reduction of
Ca
2+
in the ER lumen.
As mentioned earlier, Ca
2+
release from the MAM can
cause rapid but reversible alterations in the distance
between the MAM and the OMM [13]. The alterations that
ensue can change the efficiency in transporting ER Ca
2+
into mitochondria [11]. However, whether the Ca
2+
-de-
pendent alteration of the distance might affect the trans-
port of lipids has not been examined. Nevertheless, the
possibility is supported by the description of a Ca
2+
-sensi-
tive cytosolic S100B protein [32]. When added to a cell-free
system containing both the MAM and mitochondria,
S100B, which forms a homodimer exposing two protein-
binding sites on each end in the presence of Ca
2+
, stimu-
lates the transport of PtdSer from the MAM to mitochon-
dria [32].
Thus, there could be multiple points of crosstalk be-
tween Ca
2+
signaling and lipid metabolism, in part,
because the lipid metabolism depends heavily on ATP
and also because the enzymes involved are closely
regulated by Ca
2+
signaling.
Proteins at the ER–mitochondrion interface
MAM-specific proteins were identified serendipitously in
cellular distribution studies, including the sigma-1 recep-
tor chaperone [12] and autocrine motility factor receptor
(AMF-R) [13]. The MAM-specific proteins identified thus
far are listed in Table 1. Most of these proteins are ER
proteins, with only a few belonging to mitochondria.
Whether VDAC and uniporters (Figure 1) are more
enriched at the MAM than at other areas of the mitochon-
drial membrane is not clear. However, these proteins were
found to have a role in mitochondrial Ca
2+
signaling at the
MAM [31,33,34]. Cytochrome c, which is released from
mitochondria upon activationof apoptotic pathways down-
streamof Bcl-2,can bind IP3receptors [35,36] found at the
MAM, further activating the Ca
2+
flux and enhancing
apoptotic signaling [35,36].
Details of the functions of many of the proteins found at
the MAM, including ubiquitin ligases (e.g. AMF-R,
Met30p) have been extensively described elsewhere [5–
8]. The role of molecular chaperones in the ER–mitochon-
drion communication is only now becoming clear. Two
recent studies demonstrate that the MAM uses chaperone
machineries to regulate Ca
2+
signaling [12,37].

of chaperones and their client proteins, such as the IP3

tors are vulnerable to ubiquitylation and proteasomal
degradation upon the stimulation by IP3 [40], stabilizing
IP3 receptors during signal transduction is of considerable
importance in maintaining proper Ca

in the cytosol but also in the mitochondrion.

Grp75 links IP3 receptors to VDAC1
Recent studies have shown that type-3 IP3 receptors are
particularly enriched at the MAM, whereas type-1 IP3
receptors reside typically at the bulk ER membranes in
neuronal cells [41]. Knockdown of type-3 IP3 receptors by
the siRNA technique largely reduced the IP3-induced
mitochondrial Ca

concentration in CHO cells, whereas
knockdown of type-1 IP3 receptors reduced the Ca

from type-3 IP3 receptors in minor sequence discrepancies
and in their distributions in different types of cells. The N

enhances the Ca

bilizing conformations or the coupling of the two receptors.
Importantly, the overexpression of the cytosolic but not
mitochondrial grp75 selectively potentiates the IP3-
induced mitochondrial Ca

accumulation [37], supporting
a notion that grp75 is a key molecule constituting the link
between the two proteins on each side of the two orga-
nelles.
Calnexin and calreticulin
ER chaperones, particularly the Ca
2+
-binding chaperones
(calnexin, calreticulin and BiP), were also found to be
compartmentalized at the MAM [12,43]. Under physiologi-
cal conditions, these chaperones serve as high-capacity
Ca
2+
-binding proteins at the ER [38]. Calreticulin indeed
providesup to 45% ofthe Ca
2+
-buffering capacity for apool
of the IP3-sensitive Ca
2+
inside the ER [44]. The compart-
mentalized chaperones at the MAM therefore serve as
high-capacity Ca
2+
pools in the ER. In addition, indepen-
dent of its Ca
2+
-buffering capacity in the ER, calreticulin
inhibits IP3 receptor-mediated Ca
2+
signaling by using its
high-affinity–low-capacity Ca
2+
-binding domain [45].
Further, calreticulin regulates the activity of Ca
2+
–
ATPase, providing dynamic control of ER Ca

sis [46]. Calnexin can also regulate the activity of Ca
2+

addition, the activity and action of calnexin and calreticu-
lin are regulated by other chaperones or proteins most
likely occurring at the MAM of the ER.

The cytosolic sorting protein PACS-2 regulates the distri-

The ERp44 chaperone has an important role in control-
ling the oxidative protein folding in the ER by interacting
with Ero1-La which selectively oxidizes protein disulfide
isomerase [48]. Ero1-La lacks the ER retention signal and
is anchored to the ER by ERp44 via reversible mixed
disulfides [48]. Thus, the ERp44 chaperone favors the
maturation of disulfide-linked oligomeric proteins and
ensures their quality control [48]. ERp44 is known to
directly inhibit type-1 IP3 receptors in a planar lipid
bilayer system, indicating that ERp44 senses the environ-
ment in the ER lumen and modulates the IP3 receptor
signaling accordingly [49]. ER stress upregulates ERp44.
Another ER chaperone, ERp57, can corroborate with cal-
reticulin and facilitate the latter in regulating the activity
of Ca

Although the selection of chaperones discussed above
might not be inclusive, the data indicate a new picture
whereby molecular chaperones at the MAM might partici-
pate not only in the organization of interorganelle protein
networks but also in sensing the ER environment and
transmitting the message to mitochondria.
Concluding remarks and future perspectives
The physical interaction between ER and mitochondria is
essential for functions of the two organelles including the
control of cell death and survival. Available biochemical
and genetic data implicate specific proteins and lipids as
constituents in establishing the structural link and inter-
organelle communication between these two organelles.
Nevertheless, the number of molecules so far identified at
the interface might represent only a small number of the
total. Further elucidation and identification of other mol-
ecules at the interface will facilitate our understanding of
the mechanisms involved in the interorganelle transport
andcommunication.Urgent,asyetunanswered,questions
include: what are the constituents of the bundles that
tether the MAM to the mitochondrial membrane; what
is the molecular nature of the uniporters; and what
proteins are pertinent to lipid transports? It is interesting
to see that, in response to various cellular stimuli, a small
inter-membrane domain such as the ER–mitochondrion
interface can regulate a spectrum of biological pathways.
An ultimate question might be: what are the structural
prerequisites for these multiple pathways to converge at
the interface (the MAM) and where they are integrated in
such a manner to be regulated by the dynamic ‘puffs’ of the
second messenger Ca
2+
.
Finally, the recent discovery of chaperones and ubiqui-
tin ligases at the ER–mitochondrion interface points to a
new role for those two classes of stress proteins in the
communication between the two organelles. The inter-
actions between chaperones and client proteins are weak
and are exchangeable depending on the conformation of
the client proteins. The association occurs rapidly and
reversibly without any need for covalent modifications of
the client proteins. Ubiquitylation, however, targets
proteins to degradation by proteasomes and thus promote
a rapid elimination of proteins. Thus, the interplay and
coordination of those two classes of stress proteins might
impactthephysicalassociationbetweenERandmitochon-
dria. The cellular machinery of stress proteins might also
enable the organelles to respond promptly to changes in
microenvironments,includingforexamplethealterationof
Ca

concentrations in the cytosol or lumens of intracellu-
lar organelles. Cellular stress might, therefore, affect the
constitutive structure of the ER–mitochondrion interface
and the crosstalk. As such, cellular stress might have an
important role in cell death or survival by affecting the
activity of critical molecules at the interorganelle interface
known as the MAM. In this regard, the MAM might serve
not only as an important cellular component that inte-

Update
A recent article [65] indicates that a mitochondrial fusion
protein, mitofusin 2, can also tether ER to mitochondria,
thus, facilitating mitochondrial Ca
