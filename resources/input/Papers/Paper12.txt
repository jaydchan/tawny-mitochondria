The mitochondrial theory of aging proposes that reactive oxygen
species (ROS) generated inside the cell will lead, with time, to
increasing amounts of oxidative damage to various cell components.
The main site for ROS production is the respiratory chain inside the
mitochondria and accumulation of mtDNA mutations, and impaired
respiratory chain function have been associated with degenerative
diseases and aging. The theory predicts that impaired respiratory
chain function will augment ROS production and thereby increase the
rate of mtDNA mutation accumulation, which, in turn, will further
compromise respiratory chain function. Previously, we reported that
mice expressing an error-prone version of the catalytic subunit of
mtDNA polymerase accumulate a substantial burden of somatic
mtDNA mutations, associated with premature aging phenotypes and
reduced lifespan. Here we show that these mtDNA mutator mice
accumulate mtDNA mutations in an approximately linear manner.
The amount of ROS produced was normal, and no increased sensi-
tivity to oxidative stress-induced cell death was observed in mouse
embryonic fibroblasts from mtDNA mutator mice, despite the pres-
ence of a severe respiratory chain dysfunction. Expression levels of
antioxidant defense enzymes, protein carbonylation levels, and ac-
onitase enzyme activity measurements indicated no or only minor
oxidative stress in tissues from mtDNA mutator mice. The premature
aging phenotypes in mtDNA mutator mice are thus not generated by
a vicious cycle of massively increased oxidative stress accompanied by
exponential accumulation of mtDNA mutations. We propose instead
that respiratory chain dysfunction per se is the primary inducer of
premature aging in mtDNA mutator mice.

T
he free radical theory of aging, formulated 50 years ago by
Harman (1), proposes that aging and associated degenerative
diseases can be attributed to deleterious effects of reactive oxygen
species (ROS). Intracellular ROS are primarily generated by the
mitochondrial electron transport chain, making the mitochondrial
network a prime target of oxidative damage. Building on this, the
mitochondrial theory of aging predicts that a vicious cycle contrib-
utes to the aging process. (i) Normal metabolism causes ROS
production by the electron transport chain. (ii) ROS production
induces damage to lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids in mitochon-
dria. (iii) ROS-induced mtDNA mutations lead to the synthesis of
functionally impaired respiratory chain subunits, causing respira-
tory chain dysfunction and augmented ROS production (2). (iv)
This vicious cycle is proposed to cause an exponential increase of
mtDNA mutations over time, resulting in aging and associated
degenerative diseases. A substantial amount of correlative data
from morphological, bioenergetic, biochemical, and genetic studies
of mammalian tissues supports this theory (3). Mitochondria are
larger and fewer in older individuals, and mitochondrial abnormal-
ities such as vacuoles, abnormal cristae, and paracrystalline inclu-
sions are more often found (4). In addition, mammalian aging has
been associated with increased oxidative damage to proteins (5)
and accumulation of somatic mtDNA mutations (6–8), and there
isalsoanemergingconsensusthatthereisanage-associateddecline
of respiratory chain function with increasing age (9). Furthermore,
severalstudieshavedemonstratedacorrelationbetweentherateof
ROS formation and maximal lifespan in various animal species
(10). Caloric restriction, shown to prolong lifespan in all studied
organisms, reduces ROS production and induces antioxidant de-
fenses (11). However, most of the available data are merely
correlative and therefore do not exclude the possibility that mito-
chondrial damage and ROS production are consequences rather
than driving forces of aging. We have recently developed a mouse
model that provides experimental evidence for a causative link
between mtDNA mutations and aging phenotypes in mammals
(12). We created homozygous knock-in mice expressing an error-
prone version of mtDNA polymerase H9253 (PolgA
mut
) (12). These
mtDNA mutator mice accumulate a substantial burden of somatic
mtDNA mutations, associated with premature aging and reduced
lifespan. The mtDNA mutator mice display an apparently normal
phenotypeatbirthandduringearlyadolescence.Agingphenotypes
such as weight loss, reduced s.c. fat, alopecia, kyphosis, osteoporo-
sis, anemia, reduced fertility, and heart hypertrophy develop from
25 weeks of age (12).
We have now further characterized the patterns of mutation
accumulation and cellular metabolism in mtDNA mutator mice
and surprisingly found normal ROS production and only a very
minor increase in oxidative damage, despite profound respiratory
chain deficiency. Mutations were found to accumulate in an ap-
proximately linear manner over the mouse lifetime. The profound
aging phenotypes generated by accumulation of somatic mtDNA
mutations are thus not mediated by dramatically increased ROS
production.
Materials and Methods
Genotyping. Standard Southern blot protocols were used for PolgA
genotyping (12). Genotyping was also performed by PCR with
primers(forward,5H11032-gccatctcaccagcccgtat-3H11032;reverse,5H11032-gtgagg
aga gtg gcc gct aa-3H11032) as described (12). Animal studies were
approvedbytheanimalwelfareethicscommitteeandperformedin
compliance with Swedish law.
Analysis of mtDNA Mutations. TotalDNAwasextractedfromupper
parts of heads of embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) embryos and brains
of 10- to 11-month-old wild-type and mtDNA mutator mice. The
somatic mtDNA mutation load was determined by PCR, cloning,
and sequencing, by using primers that specifically amplified the
cytochrome b gene (nucleotide position 14093–14880) and non-
coding control region (nucleotide position 15378–117) of mouse
mtDNA as described (12).

two-way ANOVA was used to calculate statistical significance.
Quantification of Protein Carbonyls. Liver mitochondria were iso-
lated by differential centrifugation as described (15). Total protein
extracts and mitochondrial extracts were isolated as described (16).
Protein carbonyl groups were quantified with the OxyBlot protein
oxidation detection kit (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). In brief, pro-
teins (20 H9262g) were incubated with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine to
form 2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazone derivatives. 2,4-dinitrophenyl-
derivatized proteins were blotted to nitrocellulose membranes
(Hybond-CH11001; Amersham Biosciences, Arlington Heights, IL) in
serial dilutions by using the Hybri.dot 96-well filtration manifold
system (Thistle Scientific, Glasgow, U.K.). Proteins were then
immunostained by using rabbit anti-2,4-dinitrophenyl antiserum
(1:250) and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish perox-
idase(1:1,000;AmershamBiosciences).Theoxidizedproteinswere
detectedbychemiluminescence(AmershamBiosciences),followed
by exposure on x-ray films (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). The

software (Amersham Biosciences). The blots were subsequently
immunostained with an anti-actin antibody (Sigma) for standard-
ization of total protein levels. The total amount of protein in all
samples was also controlled by SDSH20862PAGE. An aliquot of 20H9262gof
each protein sample was separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel
and stained by Coomassie blue. The gels were scanned, and the
signal in each lane was quantified with IMAGE MASTER 1D ELITE
software.

and data were analyzed with the IMAGE GAUGE 3.3 program (Fuji).
The RNA loading was normalized to 18S rRNA.

We used the standard 3T3 protocol (13) to immortalize MEFs.
The mtDNA mutator and wild-type MEFs were subject to 30
passages, corresponding to approximately 40–50 cell divisions,
during the immortalization procedure. We hypothesized that this
large number of cell divisions might lead to enhanced ROS
production in mtDNA mutator cells. However, the O

Respiration Is Severely Impaired in mtDNA Mutator MEFs. Next, we
investigated whether the absence of ROS accumulation could be
explained by mitochondrial respiratory function remaining normal
despite the accumulation of mtDNA mutations. We cultivated
MEFs in high glucose media (4,500 mg per liter) to 70–100%
confluency and observed that the pH became acidic after 1–3 days
when mtDNA mutator MEFs were cultured. The medium of
wild-type MEFs remained neutral even after 1 week of culturing
under the same conditions. This finding is highly suggestive of
increased dependence on glycolysis and correspondingly decreased
oxidative phosphorylation in the mtDNA mutator MEFs. We
therefore evaluated respiratory chain function by polarographic

mutator MEFs wasH110215% that of wild-type MEFs in the absence of
exogenouslyaddedrespiratorysubstrate(Fig.1E).Weassessedthe
function of the respiratory chain by permeabilization of the MEFs
and subsequent addition of succinate. We found markedly reduced
respiration in the presence of succinate and rotenone in both
coupled and uncoupled conditions in mtDNA mutator MEFs (Fig.
1E). The finding of impaired respiratory chain function in mtDNA
mutator MEFs is in agreement with our previous report that high
levels of somatic mtDNA mutations in the heart impair the
activities of individual respiratory chain enzyme complexes as well
as the mitochondrial ATP production rate (12).

prone to undergo necrosis and apoptosis in response to oxidative
stress than wild-type MEFs.
No Difference in Oxidative Damage to Proteins. To determine the
level of oxidative damage to proteins, we measured the amount of
carbonyl groups and found no difference in total protein extracts
from hearts of 40-week-old mtDNA mutator and wild-type mice
(Fig.3A).However,asmallincreaseinoxidativedamagewasfound
in total liver protein extracts from mtDNA mutator mice (relative
levels, 139 H11006 21%) compared with wild-type mice (100 H11006 23%).
Surprisingly, carbonyl levels in protein extracts from liver mito-
chondria were not significantly different between mtDNA mutator
(107H1100619%) and wild-type mice (100H1100618%), suggesting that the
increase in total liver extracts was because of extra mitochondrial
protein carbonylation in mtDNA mutator mice.
Iron–sulfur clusters are particularly sensitive to ROS damage,
and proteins harboring such clusters may lose activity in response
to oxidative stress (22). The activity of mitochondrial aconitase is
critically dependent on an iron–sulfur cluster, and this enzyme
activity is, therefore, often used as a marker of oxidative damage.
We found normal aconitase activities in heart mitochondria from
12-, 25-, and 40-week-old mtDNA mutator mice (Fig. 3B). Hence,
no evidence of increased protein oxidation was found in mitochon-
dria of the prematurely aging mtDNA mutator mice.
No Increased Expression of Antioxidant Defense Enzymes. Increased
ROS levels will induce the expression of antioxidant defense
enzymes, and increased ROS scavenging could potentially explain

Discussion
We demonstrate that increased ROS formation and oxidative
damage are unlikely to be major pathophysiological events in the
premature aging process induced by elevated levels of mtDNA
mutations. These results are in agreement with findings from a
similar mtDNA mutator mouse model that was described recently
(23).Wehavepreviouslystudiedmitochondrialtranscriptionfactor
A(Tfam)conditionalknockoutmiceanddemonstratedthatlossof
this protein causes severe mtDNA depletion and a profound
respiratorychaindeficiencyinaffectedtissues(19,20,24–26).Loss
of Tfam leads to considerable cell death by apoptotic andH20862or
necrotic pathways in embryos (19, 20) and differentiated tissues
such as heart (19, 24), neurons (25), and insulin-secreting H9252-cells
(26).However,inTfamknockoutmice,noorminorinductioninthe
expression of enzymes involved in ROS scavenging was found,
suggesting that oxidative stress is not an important pathophysio-
logical mechanism in these animals. Loss of TFAM protein should
lead to a global decrease of all 13 mtDNA-encoded respiratory
chain subunits, resulting in an essentially quantitative defect of
respiratory chain function. In contrast, the mtDNA mutator mice
acquire an apparently random set of mtDNA point mutations,
which would be expected to result in both quantitative and quali-
tative effects on respiratory chain function. It can be anticipated
that at least some of the point mutations should result in increased
ROSproductioninmtDNAmutatormice.Itisthereforesurprising
that we found no increase of ROS production and no or minor
increase of oxidative damage in cultured cells and tissues from
mtDNA mutator mice at different ages.
ThemitochondrialtheoryofagingpredictsthatlevelsofmtDNA
mutations should increase exponentially as a consequence of a
viciouscyclebyacceleratingoxidativestress.However,wefoundan
approximately linear increase of mtDNA mutation levels from
midgestation to late adult life in mtDNA mutator mice, implying
that there is no vicious cycle. It should be noted that our measure-
mentsofmtDNAmutationloadmightbeanunderestimatebecause
cells with the highest levels of deleterious mutations may be lost
because of cell death andH20862or replicative disadvantage. Point mu-
tationsinproteincodinggenesaffectingcodonpositions1and2are
more likely to result in amino acid replacements and respiratory
chain dysfunction than mutations affecting codon position 3. It can
therefore be anticipated that point mutations resulting in a large
amount of cell death would lead to preferential loss of cells with
mutations at codon positions 1 and 2. In contrast to this prediction,
the spectrum of mtDNA mutations in protein-coding genes in
mtDNA mutator mice is apparently random with respect to codon
position (12), even in the oldest animals studied (data not shown).
Formation of 8-oxo-2H11032-deoxyguanosine (oxo
8
-dG) is the most
common consequence of oxidative damage to DNA in a cell (6). It
has been reported that aging human brain exhibits an increase of
oxo
8
-dG in mtDNA and that this increase correlates with mito-
chondrial dysfunction (27). It has since been suggested that accu-
mulation of oxo
8
-dG to high levels leads to increased levels of
mtDNA mutations, triggering mtDNA instability, reduced rates of
mitochondrialproteinsynthesis,andproductionofmutantpolypep-
tides that compromise mitochondrial respiration (for review, see
ref. 28). However, a recent study failed to find evidence of mito-
chondrial respiratory dysfunction even when levels of oxo
8
-dG are
highly elevated (29). Mice deficient for oxoguanine DNA glycosy-
lase (OGG1), an enzyme responsible for oxo
8
-dG removal, have a
20-fold increase in oxo
8
-dG levels compared with wild-type mice,
yet their mitochondria are functionally normal. The authors found
no differences in ATP synthesis rate or maximal activities of
complexes I and IV and no indication of increased oxidative stress
in mitochondria from OGG1
H11002/H11002
mice, as measured by protein
carbonylcontent(29).Suchfindingssupporttheideathatoxidative
stress may not be a major inducer of mtDNA mutations in
mammals.
Numerous investigators have reported a positive correlation
between increased ROS productionH20862oxidative damage and age (3,
30–33). Furthermore, various manipulations that increase lifespan
also diminish the age-related increase in oxidatively damaged
molecules (3, 34–36). Support for ROS involvement in aging has
been obtained from experiments on caloric restricted rodents
(37–41) and on different genetically modified flies and worms (36,
42–45). However, most of the evidence that is consistent with the
free radical theory of aging is indirect, and some results contradict
the theory. Overexpression of cytosolic Cu–Zn SOD (or SOD1)
and catalase in long-lived strains of Drosophila melanogaster pro-
ducednobeneficialeffectsonsurvivalinthemutantflies(46).The
introduction of transgenes encoding SOD2 or thioredoxin reduc-
tase in the same genetic background also failed to extend lifespan
(46). However, others have shown that overexpression of Cu–Zn
SOD in the fly resulted in an increased lifespan of up to 48%, with
no additional benefit of overexpressing catalase in the same model
(47). Experimental results obtained from genetic mouse models, in
which expression levels of different antioxidant enzymes have been
altered, are even more confusing. Overexpression of Cu–Zn SOD
in mice resulted in animals that were more resistant to cerebral
ischemia but had the same lifespan as wild-type mice (48). Con-
versely, overexpression of human catalase targeted to the mito-
chondria resulted in extension of median and maximum lifespan in
transgenic mice (39). In these animals, H

damage and the development of mitochondrial deletions were
decreased, and the development of cataract and cardiac pathology
was delayed. In contrast, targeting human catalase to peroxisomes
or nucleus did not extend the lifespan of transgenic mice (39). A
mouse heterozygous for a null mutation of SOD2 displayed 30–
80% reduced activity of this enzyme in a variety of tissues (37, 40).
This resulted in increased oxidative damage in all examined tissues

the both of the major mitochondrial antioxidant enzymes SOD2
and GPX1 (SOD2

H20862GPX1

) are extremely sensitive to oxida-
tive stress, yet appear phenotypically normal, and can reproduce
and have normal lifespan (38). It should be emphasized that the
interpretation of the above-mentioned experiments in model
organisms is complicated by the fact that ROS do not only
cause oxidative damage but also have important roles in cell
signaling (49).
There is clearly an intense, ongoing debate about the role of
ROS and oxidative stress in the aging process. The present study
showsthatthereisnodirectconnectionbetweenincreasedlevels
of mtDNA mutations and elevated ROS production and argues
against any direct role of oxidative stress in the aging process.
Because mtDNA mutator mice develop aging-related pheno-
types without evidence of increased oxidative stress, but never-
theless do exhibit respiratory chain deficiency, the latter would
seem to be a better candidate for the primary inducer of
premature aging. Respiratory chain dysfunction may accelerate
aging by provoking bioenergy deficit in physiologically crucial
cells,bydecreasingthesignalthresholdforcelldeath,bycausing
replicative senescence in stem cells, or by some other mecha-
nism.ThemtDNAmutatormousewillbeaninvaluableresource
