Summary
Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes (55S) diﬀer unexpectedly
from bacterial (70S) and cytoplasmic ribosomes (80S), as well as
other kinds of mitochondrial ribosomes. Typical of mammalian
mitochondrial ribosomes, the bovine mitochondrial ribosome has
been developed as a model system for the study of human
mitochondrial ribosomes, to address several questions related to
thestructure,function,biosynthesisandevolutionoftheseinteresting
ribosomes. Bovine mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs) from
each subunit have been identified and characterized with respect to
individuality and electrophoretic properties, amino acid sequence,
topographic disposition, RNA binding properties, evolutionary
relationships and reaction with aﬃnity probes of ribosomal
functional domains. Several distinctive properties of these
ribosomes are being elucidated, including their antibiotic
susceptibility and composition. Human mitochondrial ribosomes
lackseveralofthemajorRNAstemstructuresofbacterialribosomes
but they contain a correspondingly higher protein content (as many
as 80 proteins), suggesting a model where proteins have replaced
RNA structural elements during the evolution of these ribosomes.
Despite their lower RNA content they are physically larger than
bacterialribosomes,becauseofthe‘extra’proteinstheycontain.The
extra proteins in mitochondrial ribosomes are ‘new’ in the sense that
they are not homologous to proteins in bacterial or cytoplasmic
ribosomes.Someof thenew proteinsappeartobebifunctional. Allof
the mammalian MRPs are encoded in nuclear genes (a separate set
from those encoding cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins) which are
evolving more rapidly than those encoding cytoplasmic ribosomal
proteins. The MRPs are imported into mitochondria where they
assemble coordinately with mitochondrially transcribed rRNAs into
ribosomes that are responsible for translating the 13 mRNAs for
essential proteins of the oxidative phosphorylation system.

INTRODUCTION
The discovery of ribosomes in mitochondria (1, 2)
foreshadowed the surprising diversity of ribosome types in
nature. The prevailing notion was that ribosomes occur in two
forms, a smaller, 70S variety in prokaryotes and a larger, 80S
kind in eukaryotes. It was expected that organellar ribosomes
would be 70S particles, reminiscent of their ancestral
prokaryotic origins. However, human (mammalian) mito-
chondria contain 55S ribosomes (3). These ribosomes resemble
bacterial ribosomes and eukaryotic cytoplasmic ribosomes in
their main functional properties, but in terms of their fine
structure and physical-chemical properties, they diﬀer un-
expectedly from both these kinds of ribosomes, as well as from
other kinds of mitochondrial ribosomes (4).
Having about the same mass as bacterial ribosomes, they
contain scarcely half as much rRNA and over twice as much
protein, diﬀerences which markedly aﬀect their sedimentation
coeﬃcient and buoyant density. Many of the MRPs are
distinctive, having no closely related homologues in bacterial
or eukaryotic-cytoplasmic ribosomes and they are evolving
rapidly. Also, human mitochondrial ribosomes have acquired
an intrinsic GTP binding protein in the small subunit, an
unprecedented occurrence in translational systems (5). The
unusual properties of these ribosomes raise questions about
their relation to other kinds of ribosomes. Their large number
of proteins raises questions about their functional and
structural organization, and also about the identity of
individual MRPs that are homologous to proteins in other
ribosomes. The bovine mitochondrial ribosome has been
developed as a model system for mammalian mitochondrial
ribosomes (6) to address several questions related to the
structure, function, biosynthesis and evolution of these
interesting ribosomes.

rRNA content, compensated by a higher protein content,
results in a low buoyant density for these ribosomes, and a
correspondingly slower sedimentation rate (7). The 55S
ribosome has a sedimentation coeﬃcient of 55–56S in
diﬀerent mammals and the small and large subribosomal
particles have sedimentation coeﬃcients of 28S and 39S,
respectively (3, 8).
Size
Despite their low RNA content and lower sedimenta-
tion coeﬃcient, 55S ribosomes are actually larger than 70S
bacterial (E. coli) ribosomes, both on the basis of particle
mass, and physical dimensions. Bovine 55S mitoribosomes
have a mass of 2.83610
6
Da (7) and rat 55S mitoribo-
somes are reported to have a mass of 3.57610
6
Da (8).
The latter figure probably represents an overestimate, since
the calculations to arrive at this figure incorporated larger
values for the protein content than appears to be
contained in mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes (9, and
Tables 1 and 2). Indeed, the 55S ribosome mass calculated
from the known RNA (section 3.1) and protein compo-
nents (section 3.2) is 2.64610
6
Da. Furthermore, values
for the mass of the 28S subunit, 1.01610
6
Da, and that
of the 39S subunit, 1.63610
6
Da, are close to the earlier
estimates (9).
The 55S ribosomes are intermediate in size between
bacterial and cytoplasmic ribosomes when analyzed by pore-
gradient acrylamide gel electrophoresis (12). This size diﬀer-
ence is also apparent by electron microscopy. The dimensions
of negatively stained rat 55S ribosomes (26.2 nm, long axis)
are 24% larger than 70S E. coli ribosomes (21 nm, long axis)
(8).
COMPOSITION OF MAMMALIAN MITOCHONDRIAL
RIBOSOMES
Ribosomal RNAs
Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes contain smaller
RNAs than do bacterial ribosomes and they also lack the 5S
component found in most other ribosomes. The 12S RNA in
the small subunit of human mitochondrial ribosomes is only
954 nucleotides long (323 kDa). As such, it is about 40%
shorter than bacterial 16S RNA. The 16S RNA in the large
subunit of human mitochondrial ribosomes is only 1558
nucleotides long (528 kDa), only about half as large as
bacterial 23S RNA (13). These mitochondrial rRNAs contain
fewer modified nucleotides than other kinds of rRNAs. The
few methylated nucleotides they do contain appear to be
concentrated on the subunit interfacial regions (14). While the
large subunit RNAs of bacteria contain four to eight
pseudouridines, and those of mammalian cytoplasmic ribo-
somes contain as many as 57 pseudouridines, the correspond-
ing mitochondrial RNA contains only a single pseudouridine
at a conserved site within the peptidyl transferase domain (15).
The conservation of this single pseudouridine in an otherwise
highly divergent rRNA argues strongly for the functional
importance of this modification.
Ribosomal proteins
Estimates for the number of proteins in mammalian
mitochondrial ribosomes have ranged from about 85 (9)to
more than 100. Recently, three diﬀerent groups using
proteomic approaches to analyze the proteins of bovine
mitochondrial ribosomes (16–27) have obtained sequence
information for virtually all of the MRPs (about 80) (Tables 1
and 2). Yeast MRPs are also available, for comparative
purposes (28, 29). The nomenclature system originally used to
identify bovine MRPs was based on their electrophoretic
properties (9). Now that amino acid sequence information is
available for these proteins, it is possible to identify homo-
logues of bacterial ribosomal proteins, and the nomenclature
being adopted by the Human Genome Nomenclature Com-
mittee (http://www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/nomenclature/genefamily/
MRPs.html) for the MRPs now reflects such homology. In
this nomenclature designation, MRP homologues of bacterial
proteins are assigned the same number (MRPS1 through
MRPS21, for example). MRPs for which bacterial homo-
logues do not exist are assigned higher numbers.
The amino acid sequence is known for 30 proteins in the
small subunit (Table 1), including three isoforms of
MRPS18 (21). The three S18 isoforms diﬀer remarkably in
sequence and size, ranging from 11.7–27 kDa. Each has a
variation of a ‘core’ sequence showing homology to that
portion of bacterial S18 involved in binding to the rRNA.
The implication of this finding is that human mitochondrial
ribosomes are heterogeneous, depending on which isoform
they contain, and raises the possibility of functional
specialization for the diﬀerent mitochondrial ribosomes.
With any one of the S18 isoforms the small subunits
contain 28 diﬀerent proteins, seven more than are present in
the small subunits of eubacterial ribosomes. As expected,
most of the bacterial ribosomal proteins have counterparts
in the human mitochondrial ribosome (Tables 1 and 2).
However, homologues for the small subunit proteins S1, S3,
S4, S8, S13, S19 and S20 have not been found (21). These
are either absent from mitochondrial ribosomes, replaced by
other proteins, or are so highly divergent that they cannot
be identified with confidence. In this regard, some of the
mammalian MRPs having no identifiable homologue in
bacterial ribosomes, MRPS22 through MRPS36, may re-
place the ‘missing’ proteins.
The amino acid sequence is known for 48 proteins in the
large subunit (Table 2), thus bringing the total number of
proteins in human mitochondrial ribosomes to 78. Mito-
chondrial homologues have been identified for all of the
bacterial large subunit proteins except for L5, L6, L25, L29
and L31. Lacking L5 and L25, proteins binding to the 5S
RNA of bacterial ribosomes, is consistent with the absence
506 O’BRIEN ET AL.
of 5S RNA in human mitochondrial ribosomes. Some of the
‘extra’ proteins, MRPL37 through MRPL56, for which no
bacterial homologues exist, may replace some of the missing
proteins.
The mammalian mitochondrial ribosome is indeed protein
rich, with the large subunit containing 48 identified proteins,
15 more than are present in the large subunit of bacterial (E.
coli) ribosomes. We now see that, despite the loss of half of
their RNA, and losing a protein mass of 223 kDa, human
mitochondrial ribosomes have nevertheless grown larger than
bacterial ribosomes, by acquiring 34 extra proteins of
aggregate mass 873 kDa (Tables 1 and 2).

EVOLUTION OF MRPS
Origin of MRPs
Mitochondria appear to have arisen from an early
endosymbiosis between a eubacterium and the host cell (30).
Members of the rickettsial subdivision of the alpha-Proteo-
bacteria are considered to be among the closest known
eubacterial relatives of mitochondria. Like E. coli, these
bacteria contain 70S ribosomes and their RNA and protein
composition is very similar to that of E. coli ribosomes. The
ancestral endosymbiont probably had 70S ribosomes of
similar composition. Mitochondrial ribosomes have under-
gone some major remodeling during their intracellular
evolution, losing RNA and adding proteins, in the case of
human mitochondria. Not unexpectedly, most of the human
MRPs that have bacterial homologues also have homologues
in yeast mitochondrial ribosomes (Tables 1 and 2), reminiscent
of their common, eubacterial origin. Not so, however, for the
‘new’ MRPs that do not have homologues in bacteria. Fewer
of the MRPs in this category have homologues in yeast
mitochondria, suggesting that these MRPs were acquired in
response to diﬀerent molecular events, such as loss of rRNA
structural elements, in the human line, but not in fungi, a
consequence of their divergent intracellular evolution. It is
noteworthy, however, that humans and fungi do have a few
similar MRPs in this category, probably reflecting an earlier,
common evolutionary history for these endosymbionts.
Rapid evolution of mammalian MRPs
The proteins in mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes are
evolving more rapidly than those from cytoplasmic ribosomes
in the same cell. From a pairwise analysis of homologous
proteins in bovine and rat mitochondrial ribosomes, as well as
proteinsinbovineandratcytoribosomes(319)itwasestimated
that the mitoribosomal proteins are changing at a rate 13 times
higher than for cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins. This rate,
calculated for the entire complement of ribosomal proteins,
corresponds to an average identity of about 80% between
bovine and rat mitoribosomal proteins. Analysis of nucleotide
substitution rates for mammalian mitoribosomal RNAs
indicates that they are evolving at rates about 23 times that
of themore conserved cytoplasmic rRNAs (31). The result that
that the mitoribosomal RNA and proteins are changing at
comparableratesisespeciallyinterestinginviewofthefactthat
they are products of diﬀerent genomes, where mutational rates
are estimated to diﬀer 3–10-fold. Comparison of the
ribosomal protein and rRNA rates of evolution suggests that
the changes are being fixed at comparable rates in both the
RNA and protein components of mitochondrial ribosomes,
despite thediﬀerent mutational rates for theRNA andprotein.
Thisimpliesthatfunctionalconstraintsactmoreorlessequally
on both kinds of molecules in the ribosome. A similar
relationship also holds for cytoplasmic ribosomes in which,
despite their overall higher degree of conservation, the RNA
and proteins show essentially the same evolutionary rate (31).
SuchconcordantevolutionofRNAandproteincomponentsin
two kinds of ribosomes, which are evolving at diﬀerent rates,
implies that the proteins, as well as the RNA, are subjected to
eﬀectively similar structural/functional constraints.
RIBOSOME EVOLUTION WITH PROTEIN PROSTHESES
The two-fold greater quantity of total protein in mamma-
lian mitochondrial ribosomes is due partially to a somewhat
larger average size of the individual proteins and partially to
the larger number of proteins (9; Tables 1 and 2). If the
ancestral endosymbiont had 70S ribosomes of similar compo-
sition to those of eubacteria (section 4.1) how did the
mammalian mitochondrial ribosome acquire the additional
proteins? Was it by gene duplication, or was it by recruitment
of new proteins? It now appears that both of these processes
have been operating. Three isoforms exist for MRPS18 (21).

509PROPERTIES OF HUMAN MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMES
Apparently two rounds of duplication of the gene for
mammalian MRPS18 occurred giving rise to three very
diﬀerent isoforms (Table 1); two of these are near each other
on human chromosome 6, MRPS18A at the locus 6p21.1 and
MRPS18B at 6p21.3, while the gene for MRPS18C is on
chromosome 4 at 4q21.23.
Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes lack several of the
major RNA stem structures of bacterial ribosomes (32) but
they contain a correspondingly higher protein content,
suggesting a model where proteins have replaced RNA
structural elements in these ribosomes (33). If loss of rRNA
helices (through replication slippage? or unequal recombina-
tion?) in the endosymbiont did not otherwise interfere with
ribosome assembly, the resulting particle is expected to have a
cylindrical cavity in place of the missing stem. This cavity
flanked by basic ribosomal proteins could recruit proteins,
preferentially those with acidic domains mimicking RNA
structure, from within the mitochondrial matrix (Fig. 1).
Predictions of this model are consistent with known biochem-
ical information: (1) the ‘extra/new’ ribosomal proteins are not
homologues of proteins in bacterial, eukaryotic cytoplasmic or
yeast mitochondrial ribosomes (which have not lost the
corresponding RNA structures); (2) the new ribosomal
proteins tend to have lower isoelectric points (Tables 1 and
2); (3) recruited proteins are pre-existing (bifunctional); and
(4) protein-protein interactions predominate in mammalian
mitochondrial ribosomes (35).
One striking example of the recruitment of a pre-existing
protein is the acquisition of the protein MRPL39 (36). This
protein, originally named MRP-L5 (9, 17), is similar to the N-
terminal domain of a mitochondrial threonyl-tRNA synthe-
tase. Conceivably, this protein was recruited to the ribosome
in the form of mitochondrial threonyl-tRNA synthetase, later
losing the central and C-terminal domains by adaptive

evolution. Significantly, the tRNA binding site in the N-
terminal domain is conserved in MRPL39 (36), but whether or
not the ribosome has ‘learned’ to use this RNA binding site
remains an open question.
Another mechanism for compensating the loss of RNA
structures is for existing ribosomal proteins to become
enlarged, acquiring N- or C-terminal extensions (26, 27).
Several of theMRP homologuesof bacterial r-proteins (Tables
1 and 2) have significantly larger mass. These extensions into
sites originally occupied by RNA could help to stabilize the
ribosome structure, restoring function to a ribosome crippled
by loss of an RNA structural element. The recruitment of new
proteins to replace lost RNA and the extension of ribosomal
proteins into regions formerly occupied by RNA are graphic
examples of the evolution of mammalian mitochondrial
ribosomes from an ‘RNA world’ into a ‘protein world’, where
proteins assume the function of RNAs. It should be interesting
to accelerate this process experimentally, using a bacterial
model of the mitochondrial ribosome, to observe the further
recruitment of new proteins to the remodeled ribosome.
Why, in view of their many extra proteins, are mammalian
mitochondrial ribosomes so diﬀerent from bacterial ribo-
somes and those of chloroplasts and even plant and fungal
mitochondria? The answer may lie in the fact that these other
ribosomes did not suﬀer the RNA amputations obvious in
the mammalian mitochondrial ribosome, probably because
the corresponding deletions were corrected, as they occurred,
by processes of gene conversion or recombination. Mamma-
lian mitochondria, deficient in these activities, would retain
the mutated rDNA, amidst a population of otherwise normal
mitochondrial DNAs that could ensure a supply of
functional ribosomes. Proteins recruited in place of the
missing RNA could be remodeled during evolutionary time,
restoring function to a crippled ribosome. Selective pressure
to minimize the mitochondrial genome under these condi-
tions may have favored the population expansion and
segregation of the smaller mitochondrial genomes bearing
the rDNA deletions.
RIBOSOME-RESIDENT GTP-BINDING PROTEIN
GTP binding site
The large number of proteins in mammalian mitochondrial
ribosomes supports the idea that some of the extra proteins
may be playing structural and/or functional roles served by
RNA in the bacterial ribosome (section 5). Alternatively, some
of the ‘new’ proteins in mitochondrial ribosomes may play a
more significant role than a simple, ‘space filling’ role, as was
suggested by the discovery of a novel GTP binding site on the
small subunit of the bovine mitoribosome (5). GTP binds in
unit stoichiometry and high aﬃnity (K
d
=15 nM) to a site on
the small subunit. The binding activity survives high salt
washes, indicating that the nucleotide binds to an integral site
within the subunit. The GTP binding can be competed by
GDP, but not by other nucleotides, suggesting a direct
functional role for GTP.
GTP binding protein
GTP photoaﬃnity analogues were used to identify the GTP
binding protein as MRPS29 (MRP-S5 in the original
nomenclature of (9)), one of the new proteins in mitochondrial
ribosomes. The sequence of this mitoribosomal protein is
identical to that of DAP3 (‘death associated protein 3’), a
protein implicated in apoptosis (23, 37). It appears that
MRPS29 is a bifunctional protein. Whether the role of DAP3
in apoptosis is exerted from its position in the mitochondrial
ribosome remains an open question. Perhaps the mitoribo-
some-based function of this GTP-binding protein is entirely
separate from its role in apoptosis. On the other hand, a role
for mitochondrial ribosomes in promoting apoptosis should
not be overlooked, since another of the MRPs, MRPS30, has
also been implicated in this process. MRPS30 and PDCD9
(programmed cell death protein 9) are the same protein (23,
38). Perhaps MRPS29 and MRPS30 cooperate in triggering a
mitochondrially-induced apoptotic cascade.
GENES FOR MAMMALIAN MRPS
All of the 78 or more proteins in mammalian mitochondrial
ribosomes are products of nuclear genes. These proteins are
synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes (39) and must therefore
be imported by mitochondria for assembly with the mito-
chondrially encoded rRNA. It appears that most, if not all, of
the MRPs have cleavable, N-terminal extensions that serve as
mitochondrial import signal peptides (17, 24–27). The MRP
genes are scattered among the diﬀerent chromosomes, with no
hint that they were transferred en bloc, suggesting a piecemeal
transfer over evolutionary periods, before the mitochondrial
genetic coding changes occurred, blocking further transfers to
the nucleocytoplasmic system.
