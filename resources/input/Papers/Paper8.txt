E
ndosymbiosis, the persistence of one organism within
another, can lead to the melding of two organisms into
one. At least two common eukaryotic organelles, the mito-
chondrion and the plastid, are derived from bacteria
whose fate became linked with unicellular eukaryotes
some two billion years ago. One of the most obvious fea-
tures of organelle evolution has been the reduction in
genome size that occurred following endosymbiosis. Some
organellar genes became expendable in the internal envi-
ronment of the host, and nuclear genes have replaced the
function of some organellar genes, but much of the reduc-
tion occurred through the transfer of organellar genes to
the nucleus
1,2
.
Many genes might have been transferred to the nucleus
early on, but we now realize that there are different rates
of gene transfer and loss in eukaryotic lineages
1,3
. The
most extreme cases lie within the cradle of eukaryotic
diversity, the protists. The mitochondrial genome of the
retortomonad protist, Reclinamonas americanus, codes
for 97 genes
4
and the plastid genome of the red alga,
Many mitochondrial and plastid proteins are derived from their bacterial endosymbiotic ancestors, but their
genes now reside on nuclear chromosomes instead of remaining within the organelle. To become an active
nuclear gene and return to the organelle as a functional protein, an organellar gene must first be assimilated
into the nuclear genome. The gene must then be transcribed and acquire a transit sequence for targeting the
protein back to the organelle. On reaching the organelle, the protein must be properly folded and modified, and
in many cases assembled in an orderly manner into a larger protein complex. Finally, the nuclear copy must be
properly regulated to achieve a fitness level comparable with the organellar gene. Given the complexity in
establishing a nuclear copy, why do organellar genes end up in the nucleus? Recent data suggest that these
genes are worse off than their nuclear and free-living counterparts because of a reduction in the efficiency of
natural selection, but do these population–genetic processes drive the movement of genes to the nucleus? We
are now at a stage where we can begin to discriminate between competing hypotheses using a combination of
experimental, natural population, bioinformatic and theoretical approaches.

Porphyra purpurea, encodes 253 genes
5
. At the other
extreme, the apicomplexans, a group of parasitic protists
(which include the malarial parasites, coccidia, piroplasms
and Toxoplasma), have a mitochondrial genome of only
6 kb with just five genes and a plastid genome of 35 kb
with only 30 protein-coding genes
6
.
There are four popular hypotheses to explain the
migration of genes to the nucleus. The first is ‘insertion
happens’, but insertions occur more often in the nuclear
genome than in organellar genomes (Box 1)
7
. The second
is that once integration of an organellar gene into the
nucleus happens, the gene will disappear from the organel-
lar genome because a leaner organellar genome will have
an advantage in intraorganellar competitions
8
. The third
postulates that the frequent organellar bottlenecks that
occur during germ-line divisions and/or a haploid asexual
lifestyle lead to the fixation of deleterious mutations in
organellar genomes
9,10
. The fourth suggests that deleteri-
ous mutations are not the determinant, but that beneficial
mutations can be fixed more rapidly in the recombination-
proficient nuclear genome. These hypotheses are not
mutually exclusive, and we have reached a point where we
can begin to evaluate their relative roles in the transfer of
organellar genes to the nucleus.
Steps in time – building a functional organellar
gene in the nucleus
The process of gene transfer begins with the movement of
copies of organellar DNA to the nucleus (Fig. 1). DNA
can apparently move from the mitochondria into the
nucleus at the rate of 5 3 10
26
events per cell per gener-
ation in yeast
11
. However, most of the mitochondrial
DNA remained extrachromosomal and less than 1% of
this DNA inserted into the yeast nuclear genome
11
.
Because many of the insertions would disrupt nuclear
genes (73% of the genome is protein coding in yeast), the
integration rate is likely to be much less than the insertion
rate. Surveys of yeast nuclear genomic sequence found few
copies of mitochondrial DNA, none comprising a com-
plete mitochondrial gene
12,13
.
As in yeast, most organellar-derived sections found in
nucleus of plants and animals are fragments of genes often
less then 150 bp (Refs 12, 14). However, multigene blocks
of plastid and/or mitochondrial genomes exist in plant and
animal nuclear genomes, and might provide fodder for the
transfer process
15,16
. In felines, a 7.9 kb mitochondrial seg-
ment is found in a tandem array of 38–76 repeats
17
, and
the sequencing of Arabidopsis chromosome II turned up a
270 kb segment comprising 75% of the large Arabidopsis
mitochondrial genome
18
. Multigene chunks of mitochon-
drial DNA have also been uncovered by the Human
Genome Sequencing Project (Ref. 12 and J.L. Blanchard,
unpublished). However, because of the extensive editing
of plant chloroplast and mitochondrial sequences, and
because of changes in the animal mitochondrial genetic
code it is not clear whether these large blocks will lead to
new genes in the nucleus. Recent gene transfers in plants
appear to have been through an RNA intermediate
19–22
.
Thus, an important parameter for determining the transfer
rate is not simply the quantity of organellar-derived DNA
in the nucleus, but the potential of the segment to give rise
to a functional gene.
We also need to consider that some groups, like verte-
brates and plants, have a much larger proportion of non-
coding DNA, and that these groups appear to have more
organellar-derived DNA in their nuclear genomes than
compact genomes like those of Saccharomyces cerevisiae
and Caenorhabditis elegans. It is not clear if this is a result
of an increase in the likelihood that the insertion would
disrupt a functional nuclear gene in compact genomes or is
a result of an increased rate of deletion of noncoding DNA
as is apparent in Drosophila
23
. Other impediments of gene
transfer and a discussion of ‘why organelles have retained
genomes’ have been reviewed recently
24
.
Cases studies of natural and experimental gene
transfer
Once the organellar gene is assimilated into the nuclear
genome, there are still a number of steps to becoming an
active nuclear gene and returning to the organelle as a
functional protein. The gene must be expressed and its
protein product must acquire a transit peptide to allow
access to the organelle. As the copy number of organellar
genomes and organelles can be quite high in some tissues,
simply providing enough of the protein is likely to be a
chore for the nucleus. Finally, the problem comes of coor-
dinating the expression to different light levels or energy
needs. The complexity of this process will be dependent on
the individual gene. Although it seems an insurmountable
challenge to move an organellar gene to the nucleus, the

Calculating mutation rates is a difficult task and usually
involves some assumptions. For instance, nucleotide sub-
stitutions in a coding region that do not change the amino
acid are often referred to as having no effect on organismal
fitness (neutral). We know that this is not exactly true, but
to a first approximation it does provide a reasonable meas-
ure. We also know that mutations do not occur randomly in
the genome. CG dinucleotides are an example of a 
mutational hotspot in the nuclear genome and can
decrease in frequency following the insertion of an organellar
DNA fragment into the nucleus
52
.
Mutation rate
The number of mutations occurring in germ-line cells per
nucleotide site, per gene or per genome per unit of time or
cell division.
Mutational effect
The effect of a mutation on organismal fitness; often
referred to as the selection coefficient.
Substitution rate
The rate at which a mutation is fixed in a population. If the
mutational effect is zero (neutral) then the substitution rate
is equal to the mutation rate.
Width of the selective sieve
The substitution rate per gene divided by the mutation rate
per gene.
DNA insertion rate
The number of mutations involving the insertion of
organelle DNA into the nucleus (or vice versa) per genome
per unit of time. This rate is analogous to the mutation rate.
DNA integration rate
The rate at which a DNA insertion is fixed in a population.
This rate is analogous to the substitution rate.

challenge has been met both naturally and through human
intervention.
Following the origin of land plants, at least eleven
mitochondrial genes (coxII, coxIII, rps2, rps7, rps10,
rps11, rps12, rps14, rps19, rpl6, sdhC) and one plastid
gene (rpl22) have made a successful trek to the
nucleus
1,16,25
. Kadowaki and colleagues have recently
developed two remarkable gene transfer stories. In both
cases the mitochondrial gene acquired the N-terminal
region of a pre-existing mitochondrial targeted protein,
but the pathways were different. A plant mitochondrial
rps11 became functional in the plant nucleus after inte-
gration through a recombination–duplication event, posi-
tioning the N-terminal region of a cytochrome oxidase
subunit in front of the rps11 protein-coding region
26
. A
second copy of the rps11 gene is also found in the nucleus
but with the N-terminal region of a mitochondrial ATPase
subunit. The mitochondrial copy of rps11 is no longer
functional (it contains an internal stop codon), but it is
transcribed and edited, indicating that gene expression is
halted at the translational stage.
The mitochondrial rps14 gene integrated into an intron
in the nuclear gene encoding succinate dehydrogenase and
now both proteins are produced in the nucleus through
alternative splicing in rice
27
. A similar gene organization
and alternative splicing pattern was discovered indepen-
dently in maize
28
. In both of these cases the plant organ-
ellar gene has become an active nuclear copy by acquiring
the N-terminal region of a pre-existing organelle targeted
gene, thus providing an instant solution to expression, 
targeting and regulatory problems.
Palmer et al. have recently developed a framework for
studying the gene transfer process in action
29
. In legumes,
the integration and activation of the mitochondrial coxII
gene appears to be closely linked, as in the two previous
examples. Intense sampling of 392 legume genera revealed
that in some legume lineages the mitochondrial copy has
been lost or become nonfunctional, other lineages retained
the mitochondrial copy but the nuclear copy has become
nonfunctional, and in some lineages both copies are
expressed at varying ratios. Further investigation is under
way to test whether there is tissue-specific expression in
the plants that express both copies. Differential expression
of nuclear and mitochondrial copies of the atp9 gene has
been observed in Neurospora (Ref. 30). The possibility
also exists of regulation at the translational level (both 
the nuclear and organellar transcripts might exist but only 
one copy makes a functional protein) or at the protein
level (targeting, modification, proper assembly into the
cytochrome oxidase complex).
The above natural transfer pathways are similar to the
approaches taken by scientists to experimentally manipu-
late organellar genes into the nucleus in fungal and plant
systems. In fungi, the mitochondrial genetic code is differ-
ent from the nuclear code and the mitochondrial genes
need to be modified substantially to create an active
nuclear gene. In spite of these difficulties, a nuclear trans-
gene was constructed with roughly 70% of the wild-type
activity
31
. In plants, the process is somewhat simpler. For
the tobacco rbcL gene, the plastid gene was inserted into
an expression cassette containing the upstream targeting
sequence and regulatory regions of the nuclear rbcS
gene
32
. The rbcL nuclear transgene complements the plas-
tid null mutant, but has only 3–10% of the wild-type 
levels of RUBISCO activity. The rbcL gene is highly
expressed in the wild-type plant under photosynthetic
conditions, and as plants contain multiple copies of the
nuclear rbcS gene (whose product interacts with a one to
one stoichiometry with the RBCL protein) a single copy
might not be sufficient to restore wild-type activity.
Transfer of genetic information into organelles
Although the transfer of genes is highly polar, organellar
genomes are not refractory to exogenous DNA. Plant
mitochondrial genomes have long been known to harbor
partial and complete copies of plastid and nuclear genes
and the recent sequencing of the Arabidopsis mitochon-
drial genome has revealed a wonderful mixture of 
exogenous sequences
25,33
. In the genome can be found 
16 sections of plastid DNA, fragments of nuclear genes,
retrotransposons and sequences similar to plant-pathogen
RNA viruses: 49% of the genome is still unaccounted for.
The integration of plastid DNA has resulted in six func-
tional tRNAs. Thus, the Arabidopsis mitochondrial tRNA
repertoire now includes 12 ‘native’ tRNAs, six plastid
derived tRNAs (now mitochondrial encoded), and prob-
ably another 10 or so that are imported from the nucleus
(and derived from eukaryotic type nuclear tRNAs)
25
.
There are also well-documented insertions of introns into
plastid and mitochondrial genomes (for a recent example
see Ref. 34).

Through comparative and experimental approaches a picture of intracellular DNA transfer has gradually
emerged. Yeast mutants with increased rates of mitochondrial DNA escape appear to result from leaky
mitochondrial membranes
11
, but nucleic acids can also be shuttled out of mitochondria through
membrane transporters
56
. Either RNA or DNA can serve as transfer intermediates as evidenced by the
transfer of reverse transcribed edited mRNA transcripts and nontranscribed DNA (Refs 12, 14, 16, 22, 57).
Experimental studies also suggest that mitochondrial DNA can find its way to the nucleus independent
of an RNA intermediate
58
. In spite of extensive editing of plant plastid transcripts, no edited plastid
sequences have been found in the nucleus yet. Whole mitochondrial genomes have been observed in the
nucleus
59
, but the presence of co-ligated plastid, mitochondrial and mitochondrial plasmid sequences
in nuclear genomes
12,14
is evidence that intracellular pools of organellar RNA and/or DNA can
accumulate. These organellar DNA fragments integrate into the nuclear genome by nonhomologous
recombination at double-stranded breaks in the chromosome
12,13
.
TIG July 2000  13/6/00  8:54 am  Page 317
One surprising example of gene transfer was encoun-
tered during the sequencing of an octocoral mitochondrial
genome. This animal mitochondrial genome contains a
putative DNA repair protein (MutS-like)
35
that is not
found in any other mitochondrial genomes outside the
octocorals, even in the closely related scleractinian
corals
41
. If the scenario presented by Culligan et al.
36
is
correct, then the octocoral gene might originally have been
mitochondrial, then moved to the nucleus billions of years
ago, where it diversified into a family of six msh genes, and
finally a copy of msh3 integrated into the mitochondrial
genome in an ancestor of the octocorals.
How does the organelle gene become
superfluous?
Does a successful replacement event depend on the fitness
of the nuclear copy starting near the fitness of the organ-
ellar gene? It is likely that, as in the experimental systems,
the nuclear copy would initially be less fit than an estab-
lished organellar gene, and only through a number of
mutations or recombination events can the nuclear gene
rise up and replace the organellar gene. One solution
requires that both the organellar and nuclear copy become
essential until the nuclear copy becomes as fit as the
organellar gene. This could happen through one of three
different routes. (1) The establishment of the nuclear copy
could be a beneficial event, making up for a suboptimal
organellar gene. This would increase the integration rate
as the gene would be fixed by positive selection instead of
through drift. (2) Both genes might become essential,
owing to the accumulation of deleterious mutations in one
or both copies to the extent that the loss of one copy is not
tolerated (Fig. 2). A similar model of deleterious mutation
accumulation has been proposed to explain the persistence
of genes following genome duplications
38
. (3) A dosage–
compensation mechanism triggered by the import of 
the nuclear protein could lead to the downregulation 
of the organellar gene and/or protein. Once both copies
become essential (at least temporarily), the population–
genetic processes, such as the efficiency of selection on
beneficial or deleterious mutations, will determine the
winner.
Drift, bottlenecks and the ratchet
The image of asexual organellar genomes rising up to
many hundreds of copies per cell then crashing down to a
few copies during germ-line divisions invokes analogies
with Muller’s ratchet: the progressive loss of fitness in
finite populations because of genetic drift
39
. If organellar
genomes are effectively haploid and inherited uni-
parentally, then they will be more subject to random
genetic drift than nuclear genes, because of a fourfold
decrease (twofold because it is haploid and twofold
because of uniparental inheritance) in their effective popu-
lation size. Furthermore, although there is recent evidence
for recombination between mitochondrial halpotypes in
natural populations
40
, organelles still appear to be more
vulnerable to genetic drift through linkage disequilibrium
effects. Because organelles are a linked set of genes, fix-
ation of a beneficial mutation might result in a deleterious
mutation hitchhiking along at another site, or the rate of
fixation of a beneficial mutation might be slowed by del-
eterious mutations at other sites. The important conse-
quence of these population–genetic processes is that a
mutation will be less visible to natural selection (more 
subject to genetic drift) in an organellar gene than in an 
identical nuclear gene.
One ‘click’ of Muller’s ratchet corresponds to the loss
of the original genotype and the fixation of a less fit geno-
type. The click rate of the ratchet depends on the effective
population size, mutation rate, recombination rate and the
distribution of mutational effects. One way in which this
can be visualized experimentally is by picking a bacterial
colony at random and streaking it onto a new plate. With
each transfer, the population goes through a bottleneck of
one and the result over time is a steady accumulation of
deleterious mutations
41,42
.
Muller’s ratchet has been cited as playing a role in the
transfer of organellar genes to the nucleus
9,10
, reduction in
organelle and bacterial genome sizes
43
, changes in animal
mitochondrial genetic code
10
, occurrence of mRNA edit-
ing
44
and a role for organelle genomes in extinction
processes
45
. An important assumption in invoking a
ratchet-like process is that the population cannot regain its
original fitness because compensatory mutations are rare
and have small positive mutational effects.
Direct comparison of nuclear, organellar and bacterial
tRNA structures suggests that organellar tRNAs are less
thermodynamically stable than their nuclear counterparts
and eubacterial ancestors, and a greater variance in the
organellar tRNA loop and stem regions indicates that
more sites are subject to drift
46,47
. Thus, the relatively
greater width of the selective sieve in organelles (Fig. 3) is
not simply a balance of deleterious and compensatory
mutations that results in no net change in fitness or a
faster recycling of the same sites. The reduction in fitness
from Muller’s ratchet is a very long-term process and is
not likely to endanger species on timescales of less than a
million years

This graph starts with organelle gene activity at 100% and with duplicated
nuclear copy activity at 50%. Initially, there is an excess of enzyme activity
(protein quantity). As soon as the organelle gene’s activity dips below 100%,
both copies are essential. Deleterious mutations will continue to occur through
genetic drift until the total efficiency of two genes is reduced to the level of the
initial singe copy (end of gray area). If the organelle gene continues to fall in
fitness because of Muller’s ratchet (or a decreased efficiency in selection),
beneficial mutations could accumulate in the nuclear copy until the activity of
the nuclear copy reaches 100%. At this point the organelle gene can be lost
without consequence to the cell or host.
TIG July 2000  13/6/00  8:54 am  Page 318
Other organelles, including bacteriocytes (non-cell
autonomous organelles found in many insects), show signs
of decreased rRNA stability and high rates of substitution
relative to their free-living and nuclear counterparts
48
.
Selection might be relaxed against some organellar genes,
as in nonphotosynthetic plastids, but some simple calcula-
tions suggest that the reduced fitness is primarily a result
of the smaller effective organellar population sizes
45
.
However, theoretical models suggest that the germ-line
bottlenecks, instead of facilitating Muller’s ratchet, can
act to slow any ratchet-like process by increasing genetic
variability in the population thereby making selection
more effective
49
.
Some organellar genes do not show signs of the accu-
mulation of deleterious mutations, but are subject to
greater genetic drift than their nuclear counterparts. Plant
chloroplast tRNAs are indistinguishable in their stem sta-
bility from their nuclear counterparts, but have wider
sieve widths
47
(Fig. 3). Therefore, in plant chloroplast
tRNAs, deleterious mutations might be fixed by drift fol-
lowed by compensatory mutations. The result is that rela-
tively more organellar sites are subject to drift, but with no
net change in fitness. Thus, although genetic drift is a com-
ponent of Mullers’ ratchet, increased genetic drift does not
implicate a role for Muller’s ratchet.
How quickly is the race run?
Several groups have compared mutation and substitution
rates of organellar genes with either functional
50
or non-
functional copies in the nucleus
51,52
. In each study, the
organelle sequences in the nucleus now conform to the
nuclear mutation rate and pattern. The rate at which genes
become silenced is dependent on the mutation rate. If all
else is equal, the copy in the genome with the lower
mutation rate will persist longer. In plants the nuclear
mutation rate is orders of magnitude higher than the mito-
chondrial mutation rate, thus the nuclear copy should be
inactivated much more frequently than the mitochondrial
copy if the process is driven solely by the mutation rate.
Therefore, we would expect to see few, if any, plant mito-
chondrial gene transfer events, which is in contradiction to
the many events previously referenced. Furthermore,
Adams et al.
29
have reported a similar number of separate
mitochondrial and nuclear coxII gene inactivations within
legumes. Thus, the mitochondrial copy seems to be losing
more often than the mutation rates would dictate. Further
investigation of the legume coxII system should provide
valuable information on rates of synonymous versus non-
synonymous substitutions, and should provide a test of
whether the mitochondrial and/or nuclear copy is sub-
jected to elevated drift.
Selection for smaller organellar genomes either at the
organismal or intraorganellar level could tilt the scales
towards the nuclear copy by speeding up the rate at which
an organellar deletion is fixed. Large mitochondrial
deletions can confer a replicative advantage to the smaller
mitochondrial genome, in spite of the negative conse-
quences for the host. Case studies of gene transfer in
plants suggest that a mitochondrial gene can become non-
functional due to 21 frameshift mutations and/or the for-
mation of stop codons. Some of these nonfunctional
organellar genes are still expressed and edited, and some
have no obvious defect in the protein-coding sequence
16,26
.
Thus, the first step in nonfunctionalization of an organ-
ellar gene often does not involve a large deletion. However,
point mutations, like a single substitution in a tRNA gene,
can put the mutant mitochondrial genome at a replicative
advantage
53
. Recent computer simulation studies have
suggested parameters important in the deletion of unnec-
essary mitochondrial genes
54
.
In plants, because of the high nuclear mutation rate, a
frameshift mutation or other types of gene-inactivating
mutations would probably occur within a few million
years. Thus, both the ‘integration happens’ and the small-
genome-size models predict that the race would be run in
or under a few million years. However, the process of gene
transfer for coxII and the plastid rpl22 gene has been
ongoing for at least 60 million years
21,55
(but these esti-
mates might need downwards revision; see Ref. 29). Why
is the process taking so long? It is likely that, as in the
experimental systems, the nuclear copy would initially be
less active than an established organellar gene and the loss
of the organellar copy would be selected against. Thus, the
models mentioned above that require the retention of both
copies would need to be invoked.

Ratio of organellar to nuclear selective sieve
trends in Genetics
FIGURE 3. Accelerated substitution rates in organellar genomes 
The relative width of the selective sieve is the ratio of organellar or nuclear substitutions standardized
by their respective mutation rates. The ratio of the organelle to nuclear selective sieve widths is shown.
In all categories, the ratio is greater than one, indicating the mutations in organellar genes are relatively
less visible to selection. This is in spite of the tremendous variation in substitution rates that run from
an order of magnitude higher in vertebrate mitochondria to an order of magnitude lower in plant
mitochondria relative to their respective nuclear genes. Thus, mutation rates are not the determinant of
whether a gene is relatively more prone to genetic drift. Data are taken from Refs 45–47. The black,
white and gray bars are tRNA, rRNA and protein-coding genes, respectively.
TIG July 2000  13/6/00  8:54 am  Page 319
During the timecourse when both copies are present, an
organellar gene might lose fitness because of drift, setting
the stage for compensatory mutations to come in through
the nuclear gene as in Fig. 2. Then beneficial mutations
could accrue in the nuclear copy to a level where the
organellar gene can be lost with no fitness consequence to
the host. Thus, a high mutation rate in the nuclear copy
(as in plants) might no longer be a handicap, but might
hasten the generation of beneficial mutations.
Time to test hypotheses
Currently, we cannot provide a satisfactory answer to why
the nucleus is the preferred location for organellar genes
or why there are different rates of gene transfer in 
different taxon groups. In the next few years, we can
expect progress in defining and estimating the parameters
needed to explain why organellar genes end up in the
nucleus. Genome projects should allow us to estimate the
rate and size of organelle DNA insertions in nuclear
genomes, allow the detection of other functional nuclear
copies of organellar genes and allow us to determine
whether flanking regions of DNA insertions are derived
primarily from pre-existing genes. As there are many
recent examples of gene transfer in plants, surveys of plant
species should reveal the time periods over which the
organellar gene and the nuclear copy are expressed.
Experimental approaches can be used to test directly for
dosage compensation. There is also a need to develop
theoretical models, and to test the role of deleterious and
beneficial mutations in organelle evolution. Together these
efforts will help provide answers to a question that is often
subject to speculation.
