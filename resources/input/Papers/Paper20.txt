of mitochondria have received particular attention: Ca

response to death signals [2]. The ER is also involved in
Ca

homeostasis because it acts as the principal internal
store of Ca

ions. In addition, it is responsible for the
synthesis of the majority of phospholipids and, in the case
of the rough ER, of most membrane proteins and of soluble
proteins destined to the secretory pathway. In striated
muscle, the ER is organized structurally and functionally

roles in cell physiology; for example, for the release of
neurotransmitters in synaptic terminals or for enabling
fast mitochondrial uptake (reviewed in Ref. [4]). The Ca
2+
signals are complex not only spatially but also temporally.
Thus, in excitable cells, the Ca
2+
increases follow the
pattern of membrane-potential oscillations, however, in
non-excitable cells, activation of membrane receptors also
often results in repetitive cytosolic Ca

oscillations owing
to cycles of Ca

release and uptake from the ER. Note-
worthy, cells have devised ways to decode not only the
amplitude but also the frequency of such Ca

ER and mitochondria: structure and dynamics
The ER and mitochondria are known to be highly motile
within most eukaryotic cells. Such dynamics depend on
continuous fusion and budding of vesicles from the main
membrane network (in the ER), fusion and fissionbetween
mitochondria and short- or long-range movements of indi-
vidual vesicular elements along cytoskeletal structures. In
afew cell types, suchas striated muscle, the morphology of
the two organelles is highly ordered and stable, character-
ized by the localization of part of the mitochondria in
close apposition to SR terminal cysternae. The problem
ofSR–mitochondriainteractionsinstriatedmusclewillnot
be dealt with here in any detail (but see [7] for more
information).
The ER is a complex organelle composed of membrane
sheets that enclose the nucleus (the nuclear envelope) and
an elaborate interconnected tubular network in the cyto-
sol. This highly dynamic and elaborate structure is main-
tained by a constant remodeling process that involves the
formation of new tubules, their transport along the cytos-
keleton and homotypic fusion [8]. The movement of ER
tubules in animal cells is known to depend on the micro-
tubule network, mainly reflecting microtubule dynamics
and involving kinesinfamily proteins, althoughperipheral
ER tubules also move along actin filaments [9]. Several
proteins are involved in the interaction of polymerizing
microtubules and ER structures [8]. These include p22, a
myristoylated protein containing an EF-hand Ca
2+
-bind-
ingdomain;thisproteinbindsmicrotubulesandassociates
to ER membranes in a Ca
2+
-dependent manner [10], pro-
viding a potential Ca
2+
-regulated link between the ER and
the cytoskeleton (see also later).
The classical view of mitochondria, that is, small
(<1 mm in size) vesicular structures scattered throughout
the cytoplasm, has been challenged over recent decades
by the demonstration that mitochondria are rather
represented by organelles of different sizes, in equilibrium
with a highly dynamic reticular network, where the shape

[11].Themovementofmitochondriacanbelimitedtolocal,
short-range motility from morphological alterations of the
mitochondrial network or migrations of the circular orga-
nelles across long distances (e.g. along axons). It is gener-
ally believed that the movement of mitochondria depends
on, and occurs along, the microtubule network, typically
mediated by the molecular motor proteins kinesin and
dynein; the actin cytoskeletonisalsoinvolved,although
itsroleislessdefined[12] (see also Ref. [13] in this issue).
How molecular motors control mitochondrial movement
is not completely clear. Recent work in Drosophila ident-
ified two proteins that seem to be important for mito-
chondrial transport: Milton, a cytoplasmic protein that
can be co-immunoprecipitated with kinesin heavy chains
[14], and Miro, an integral protein of the outer mitochon-
drial membrane (OMM) [15]. Kinesin, Milton and Miro
are thought to work together, with Milton responsible
www.sciencedirect.com
for the attachment of kinesin to the organelles through
Miro [16].
An interesting and unique feature of mitochondria is
that the distribution of these organelles seems to vary
according to local energy requirements. For example,
within neurons, mitochondria are more crowded at sites
associated with high energy demands, such as presynaptic
terminals, active growth cones and branches, nodes of
Ranvier or regions of axonal protein synthesis [17]. More-
over, glutamate-induced cytosolic Ca
2+
increases inhibit
mitochondrial mobility in neurons and this was suggested
to occur as a result of local ATP depletion [18]. It is,
however, still unclear whether ATP itself or other signals,
Ca
2+
in particular, control this mitochondrial localization.
For example, in HEK293 cells, maximal mitochondrial
movement occurs at the resting level of cytosolic Ca
2+
,
whereas complete suppression of motility is observed at
the peak ofagonist-induced cytosolic Ca
2+
oscillations [19].
These and other findings have led to the proposal of a
model in which the temporal and spatial coordinated
regulation of mitochondria movement and their subcellu-
lar distribution is controlled by the cytosolic concentration
ofboth Ca
2+
and ATP,ensuringthe right amountofenergy
is available at the right time and place within the cell [20].
Of interest, the mitochondrial protein Miro contains two
predicted EF-hand domains [21,22] and it might be specu-
lated that, thanks to these domains, Miro might be
involved in Ca
2+
-dependent regulation of mitochondrial
motility [23]. It should be stressed that mitochondrial
localization might also be modulated in response to other
physiological signals: for example, in dorsal root ganglion
neurons, activation of TrkA receptors by NGF activates
PI3K, which results in actin-dependent docking of mito-
chondria in axons [24].
ER–mitochondrial interactions
It has been known for a long time that, in electron
micrographs of different cell types, mitochondria and ER
cysternae are often in close contact but such images were
considered to be largely artifacts of fixation. Experiments
in living cells with the two organelles labeled by green-
fluorescent protein (GFP) [25] and electron micrograph
images of samples frozen quickly [26] have demonstrated
conclusively that such physical interactions between the
two organelles indeed exist. Recently, it has also been
shown by electron tomography that ER and mitochondria
areadjoinedbytethers(10 nmatthesmoothERand25 nm
at the rough ER) and that coupling between these two
organelles can be weakened and strengthened by demoli-
tion and enforcement of this inter-organellar protein link-
age [27]. Some evidence supports the hypothesis that the
movement of mitochondria might occur concomitantly and
in synchrony with that of specific ER regions. The mech-
anism of this reciprocal organelle-docking remains unre-
solved but it has been proposed that it depends on the
expression on both membranes of complementary proteins
that link the two organelles together, possibly at specific
sites (Figure 1). For example, the voltage-dependent anion
channel (VDAC) of the OMM interacts physically with the
inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (Ins(1,4,5)P
3
R) on
the ER through the molecular chaperone grp75 [28].It

is unknown presently whether and to what extent the
physical interactions between the ER and mitochondria
are stable or dynamic. However, it should be stressed that
the close apposition of mitochondria to the ER membrane
coversasmallfractionoftheorganellesurface[25].Accord-
ingly, in the case of elongated mitochondria, only one part
of the organelle is anchored to the ER and the rest can
move independently.
The interactions between the two organelles seem to
also be modulated by fission and fusion of mitochondria.
Fission and fusion are regulated by a family of ‘mitochon-
dria-shaping proteins’ (Figure 1). In mammals, the best
characterized of these proteins is DRP-1 [29], a cytosolic
dynamin-relatedproteinthatinteractsatfissionsites with
its molecular adaptor hFis1 [30] (an integral protein of the
OMM), and promotes mitochondrial fragmentation. Mito-
fusin (MFN)1 and 2 also reside in the OMM and regulate
mitochondrial fusion [31]; the fusion mediated by MFN1

Fusion and fission of mitochondria can be regulated by

. The recruitment of DRP-1 to mitochondria seems to
be stimulated by Ca

uptake into the organelles [33],
whereas fragmentation of the mitochondrial network,
induced by over-production of DRP-1, reduces the global
amplitude of mitochondrial Ca

same lines, over-production of the ER-associated protein
p20, a cleavage product of the Bcl-2-interacting protein

subsequent recruitment of the fission protein DRP-1 to

has thus been suggested that PACS-2 could control the
apposition of rod-like mitochondria to the ER, influencing
multiple organelle-specific functions, such as mitochon-
drial fusion–fission events, lipid metabolism and apopto-
sis. The existence of mutual interactions between the two
organelles is further supported by the finding that BIK, a
BH3-only member of the Bcl-2 family, is anchored on
the ER surface and induces the recruitment of DRP-1 to
mitochondria [36] (Figure 1).

ER–mitochondria interactions in cell signaling and
metabolism
ExchangeofmetabolitesbetweenmitochondriaandtheER
occurs continuously during the life span of a cell. For
example, ATP produced by oxidative phosphorylation is
used by ATPases located within the ER (membrane or
lumen); in the opposite direction, products of ER metabolic
pathways, such as phospholipids, are transferred continu-
ously to the mitochondrial membranes. As to ER–mito-
chondria phospholipid transfer, probably one of the best
studied is that involved in phosphatidyletanolamine bio-
synthesis.Phosphatidylserine(PS)is,infact,synthesizedin
the ER by two enzymes (phosphatidylserine synthase and
phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase), trans-
portedto the mitochondria and decarboxylatedat the outer
surface of the IMM by phosphatidylserine decarboxylase
[39]. This process of lipid transfer depends on the physical
association between the two organelles. The transfer of
phospholipidsbetweenthetwoorganellesisconsistentwith
a collision-based mechanism in which the two structures
come into close contact with one another [40]. Indeed, a
majorfractionofPSislocalizedinanER-relatedmembrane
fraction that is tightly associated to mitochondria, the so
called ‘mitochondria-associated membranes’.
However, the aspect of functional interaction between
the ER and mitochondria that has received most attention
in recent decades is undoubtedly that involving Ca
2+
ions.
This is because Ca
2+
exchange between the ER and
mitochondria not only has a crucial role in regulating
the physical interactions between the two organelles,
as described earlier, but it also regulates a variety of
physiological processes, including aspects of apoptosis
and necrosis.
The process of Ca

exchange between the ER and the
mitochondria is often looked at simplistically as the ER

mammalian tissues oxidize glycolytically derived

formation of specific pores (permeable to small proteins) made by
the oligomerization on the OMM of proapoptotic proteins or on the
rupture of the OMM, owing to swelling of the matrix. Swelling of the

mitochondria enhances ATP production, an effect that
lasts longer than the Ca

novel form of ‘metabolic memory’ at the cellular level
[48].
This Ca

part depends on the capacity of mitochondria to accumu-
late Ca

within their matrix through the so-called ‘Ca

ated by the respiratory chain (or by ATP hydrolysis). Ca
2+
is then extruded back into the cytosol by antiporters (Na
+
or H

/Ca
2+
), driven by the ion gradients [4]. The molecular
identities of the uniporter and of the antiporters are still
unknown but a very recent report [50] has shed some light
on the nature of the uniporter. In particular, it has been
shown (using siRNA, cells from knockout mice and protein
over-expression) that the so called ‘uncoupling proteins 2
and 3’ might be part of this elusive entity that has escaped
identification, despite intense research, for over 40 years.
The speed and amplitude of Ca

accumulation in
response to ER Ca

release in living cells are much faster
and larger than expected from the low affinity for Ca

of
the uniporter, as measured in vitro [51]. In situ, the rapid
accumulation of Ca

by mitochondria seems to depend on
the generation, close to the organelles, of cytosolic micro-
domains of high [Ca

or ER Ca

respond promptly to physiological rises in cytosolic Ca

membrane (IMM) that causes massive ion and water influx into the
matrix. The PTP can be opened by various conditions, including a
prolonged Ca
2+
influx. The Bcl-2 family includes more than 25
proteins that contain one or more Bcl-2 homology domain (BH
domains). Functionally, Bcl-2s are divided into anti-apoptotic
proteins, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L), and proapoptotic proteins,
including Bax, Bak, Bid and Bad [77]. Bcl-2 proteins form oligomers
with each other commonly and a delicate balance between anti- and
pro-apoptotic proteins is required to maintain the integrity of the
OMM permeability barrier. Bcl-2 members can either constitutively
bind to both the ER and the mitochondrial membrane and/or are
recruited from the cytoplasm onto the organelles on activation.
Some anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 members (Bcl-2 itself and Bcl-XL) can
affect ER Ca
2+
storage. For example, Bcl-2 over-expression results in
a decrease of ER luminal [Ca
2+
] and this effect has been attributed to
an increase in the Ca
2+
leak from the organelle [68–71]. Moreover,
knockdown of Bax and Bak increases the interaction of Bcl-2 with the
type-1 IP3Rs and promotes both the phosphorylation of the IP3R and
a constitutive Ca
2+
leak through the IP3Rs under basal conditions
[72–74] (Figure 1). A reduced ER Ca

overexpression or knockdown of Bax/Bak, reduces the amount of

2+
that can be released from the ER owing to an apoptotic
stimulus and thus decreases the probability of a Ca
2+
-dependent
PTP opening (reviewed recently in [76–79]). In addition, released
Ca
2+
from the ER, acting on mitochondria-shaping proteins (DRP-1,
hFis1, OPA1, MFNs; Figure 1), can also influence mitochondrial
cristae remodeling and thus the amount of cytochrome c that can be
released in the cytosol [33].

findings,amongwhich:(i)over-expressionofanti-apoptotic
proteins, such as Bcl–2, reduce the ER Ca
2+
level [68–71];
(ii) down-regulation of proapoptotic proteins, such as
Bak and Bax, reduces the ER Ca
2+
concentration [72–
74]; (iii) cytochrome c release linked to DRP-dependent
mitochondrial fragmentation depends on ER Ca
2+
release
andBAP-31cleavage[33,36](Figure1).Itremainsunclear
how the rise in mitochondrial Ca
2+
(that has probably
evolved to couple cell signaling to metabolic activation)
can be transformed into a trigger of cell death. Both the
amplitude and, most importantly, the duration of the Ca
2+
riseinthemitochondriahaveamajorroleinthetransition.
Itisourbiasedopinion,however,thatevenmoreimportant
to transform Ca
2+
into a trigger of cell death is the con-
comitant production of other insults that affect mitochon-
drial functions (e.g. ceramide, oxygen radicals). In other
words, the trigger for Ca
2+
-dependent mitochondrial acti-
vation of cell death seems to be a form of coincidence
detection system: only when both signals (Ca
2+
and the
toxic insult) are triggered simultaneously will the whole
machinery of apoptosis become activated [75,76].
In the context of the mitochondria–ER relationship, it
should be stressed that several proteins of the Bcl-2 family
that have either a pro- or an anti-apoptotic role are located
on both the ER membrane and the OMM, such as Bcl-2
itself, Bax, Bak and Bcl-XL (Figure 1), again indicating
that the two organelles act in concert in this key process
[77]. Space limitations prevent us from discussing further
the involvement of mitochondria and ER Ca
2+
in the con-
trol of apoptosis; the interested reader is referred to recent
reviews [2,4,78,79] (Box 1).
Concluding remarks
The correct organization and the mutual interactions
between the ER and mitochondria seem to coordinate
importantfunctionsofthetwoorganellesandtodetermine
key aspects of cell physiology, death and survival. Future
researchinthisfieldwillbefundamentalinunderstanding
themolecular mechanismsthat underliespecificER–mito-
chondriacommunicationinrelationtotheparticularneeds
of different cells.
In particular, a few hot questions are still largely unan-
swered, such as: (i) what is the molecular nature of the
proteins that link the ER and mitochondrial membranes?
(ii) How are they regulated? (iii) What is the nature of the
mitochondrialCa
2+
uniportandoftheantiporters?Wealso
expect that more quantitative data will become available
on the size and concentration of the Ca
2+
microdomains
generated at the mitochondria–ER interface, on the mech-
anisms, regulation and role of mitochondrial fusion and
fission and on the role of mitochondria/ER Ca
2+
-dependent
crosstalk in the control of apoptosis.
