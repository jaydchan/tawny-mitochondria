Introduction
Iron–sulfur clusters are ancient cofactors utilized in nearly
every life form
.[1]
These Fe–S clusters are constructed of in-
organic iron and sulfide linked together in a branched fash-
ion with each iron in direct contact with at least two sulfur
atoms. The simplest and most common types of Fe–S clus-
ters found within eukaryotes are the rhombic [Fe
2
–S
2
] and
cubic [Fe
4
–S
4
] forms; however, examples of more complex
forms up to the [Fe
8
–S
8
] can be found in bacteria and
archea.
[2]
During the origin of ancient earth, spontaneous
formation of Fe–S clusters took place easily under anaerobic
conditions due to the high abundance of both iron and
sulfur and their propensity to coordinate with each other.
However, with a global shift to an aerobic environment,
cells adapted to assemble these air-sensitive clusters by de-
veloping complex protein controlled mechanisms to com-
plete cluster biosynthesis.
[3,4]
Once produced, Fe–S clusters
are loaded onto proteins and these metalloproteins can be
found in nearly every fundamental pathway in almost every
cell. Some classic examples of where these important pro-
teins function include within the mitochondrial complexes
(I, II, and III) of the respiratory chain, as aconitase within
citric acid cycle, and as ferredoxins used for electron-trans-
fer and signaling.
[5]
Biological pathways for assembling Fe–S clusters are ac-
complished using a highly conserved group of protein part-
ners. While Fe–S clusters are simple in regards to their
chemical structure and composition, their cellular synthesis
must be kept tightly controlled given the high reactivity of
iron and the instability of the cluster with regards to oxygen
based chemistry. As a result, multifaceted protein-controlled
machineries direct the production of the cluster. In bacteria,
there are three different pathways for the production of Fe–
S clusters: 1) the nitrogen fixation (Nif) pathway, used for
the maturation of nitrogenase; 2) the general iron–sulfur
cluster (ISC) pathway, which provides clusters for most cel-
lular needs; and 3) the sulfur mobilization (SUF) pathway,
highly active under oxidative stress conditions.
[4,6,7]
All three
pathways involve a central scaffold protein, a sulfur donor,
and an iron donor during biosynthesis of the clusters. Each
of these pathways have been extensively studied for bacteri-
al Fe–S cluster production predominately in the Escherichia
Coli and Azotobacter vinelandi systems
.[6,8,9]
In eukaryotes, the mitochondrial ISC assembly pathway is
the central channel for the biological production of Fe–S
clusters.
[10]
The mitochondrial Fe–S cluster assembly path-
way utilizes several of the same players used within the dif-
ferent bacterial assembly systems.
[11,12]
General players uti-
lized during the production stage include a scaffold protein
that accomplishes assembly, a cysteine desulfurase that sup-
plies sulfide to the scaffold protein, an iron chaperone that
delivers metal to the scaffold protein, and a ferredoxin that
provides reducing equivalents for cluster assembly.
[13,14]
For
the most part, these proteins are highly conserved between
eukaryotes and also within the different bacterial assembly
production pathways.
[5,15]
Following assembly, a complex
network of proteins participate in the transfer and delivery
of functional clusters to ensure the newly produced Fe–S
clusters are utilized properly. In this article, we will explore
the structural and functional roles of key proteins within the
mitochondrial Fe–S cluster assembly pathway, focusing on
the yeast model system when giving specific examples.
Mitochondrial Fe–S Cluster Assembly Pathway
In yeast, mitochondrial Fe–S cluster assembly is a multistep
and highly controlled protein driven process.
[16,17]
Since free
iron and sulfur are toxic, it is important that assembly be
Abstract: Iron–sulfur clusters are multifaceted iron-con-
taining cofactors coordinated and utilized by numerous
proteins in nearly all biological systems. Fe–S-cluster-
containing proteins help direct pathways essential for
cell viability and participate in biological applications
ranging from nucleotide biosynthesis and stability, pro-
tein translation, enzyme catalysis, and mitochondrial
metabolism. Fe–S-containing proteins function by utiliz-
ing the unique electronic and chemical properties inher-
ent in the Fe containing cofactor. Fe–S clusters are con-
structed of inorganic iron and sulfide arranged in a dis-
tinct caged structural makeup ranging from [Fe

] clusters. In eukaryotes,
cluster activity is controlled in part at the assembly
level and the major pathway for cluster production
exists within the mitochondria. Recent insight into the
pathway of mitochondrial cluster assembly has come
from new in vivo and in vitro reports that provided
direct insight into how all protein partners within the as-
sembly pathway interact. However, we are only just be-
ginning to understand the role of each protein within
this complex pageant that is mitochondrial Fe–S cluster
assembly. In this report we present results, using the
yeast model for mitochondrial assembly, to describe the
molecular details of how important proteins in the path-
way coordinate for cluster assembly.

tightly regulated within the cell. Given the high correlation
between human and yeast systems, and the availability of
well-established techniques for studying yeast genetics, a
large amount of the details regarding eukaryotic mitochon-
drial Fe–S cluster assembly have come from studies per-
formed using the yeast model system. Key molecular details
for yeast cluster assembly pathway are given in Figure 1.
Overall, Fe–S cluster assembly involves two steps: step 1 is
the transient synthesis of cluster production on a scaffold as-
sembly protein and step 2 is the transfer of a formed cluster
to target apo proteins.
[13,18,19]
Each stage is completed utiliz-
ing a coordinated set of proteins acting in a choreographed
fashion.
For discussion, it is beneficial to break down each stage
and look at the key players individually. In the first stage of
Fe–S cluster assembly, iron is imported into the mitochon-
dria. In yeast, iron is imported into the mitochondria by
means of the inner membrane proteins Mrs3 and Mrs4, ac-
complished in a membrane potential, proton motive force
driven fashion.
[20]
Iron delivery to the Fe–S cluster assembly
protein (Isu1 and or Isu2 in yeast) takes place most likely in
a protein-controlled manner, and this iron chaperone func-
tion has been proposed for the protein frataxin (Yfh1 in
yeast).
[21]
The sulfur component of the Fe–S cluster origi-
nates from the amino acid cysteine through the activity of
the cysteine desulfurase Nfs1, a pyridoxal phosphate con-
taining enzyme. In eukaryotes Nfs1 must assemble with an
essential small subunit of unknown function called
Isd11.
[22,23]
A persulfide intermediate formed on the active
site cysteine of Nfs1, perhaps requires an electron donor to
convert the sulfane S
0
to sulfide S
2C0
during transfer to the
Fe–S scaffold intermediate.
[24]
The ferredoxin reductase
Arh1 and ferredoxin Yah1 have been suggested to be in-
volved at this step, utilizing electrons from NADH
[25]
or
NADPH.
[26]
The cluster produced on the scaffold protein
(Isu1 or Isu2) is labile, suggesting that it may constitute an
intermediate for transfer to apoprotein recipients during the
second stage of the pathway.
[5]
Several proteins have been
implicated in the transfer of functional clusters from the
scaffold intermediate to their recipient apoproteins, al-
though this assembly stage has not been biochemically char-
acterized in detail. Four proteins are thought to participate
in this transfer, including a chaperone protein of the Hsp70
ATPase family (Ssq1), a DnaJ-like cochaperone protein
(Jac1), a nucleotide exchange factor protein (Mge1) and the
monothiol glutaredoxin (Grx5).
[3,5]
Binding of Ssq1 to Isu1/2
(in the highly conserved LPPVK region) stimulates the
ATPase activity of Ssq1 when Jac1 is also present, while
Mge1 is required for exchanging bound ADP with ATP. The
ATPase cycle somehow mediates release and transfer of the
Fe–S cluster intermediates to apoproteins. Atm1, a mito-
chondrial inner membrane ABC transporter, is believed to
export some component or signal for extramitochondrial
Fe–S cluster assembly.
[27–29]
This component is essential for
maturation of cytosolic Fe–S binding proteins. An inter-
membrane space sulfhydryl enzyme Erv1 plays an important
role in forming disulfide bridges and facilitating export. Glu-
tathione (GSH) assists in the transport process in a manner
that is not clear.
In this concept article, we will focus only on the proteins
in the mitochondrial assembly pathway (step 1). With regard
to Fe–S cluster assembly, many of the players are known,
but the molecular details of how they interact and in each
case the role of an essential partner interaction remains un-
clear. In particular, the identity of the iron donor has been
controversial. Frataxin is believed to perform this function,
based on the proteinC29s ability to bind iron, promote in vitro
cluster assembly on Isu1 and an extensive amount of genetic
evidence indicating Yfh1 interacts in vivo with Isu1 (and
with Nfs1-Isd11), an interaction that is essential for cluster
assembly.
[21,30–33]
However, recent reports suggest an alterna-
tive role for frataxin acting as a gatekeeper for the forma-
tion of clusters.
[34,35]
Regarding the scaffold protein, the
mechanism for iron loading and details regarding the se-
quence of events for when/how protein partners interact
with Isu1 remains unclear. Finally, the role of Isd11 is not
well established yet. In this report, we will explore individu-
ally and in complex the molecular details of the interaction
between assembly protein partners.
The Isu1 scaffold protein: This protein is a member of the
U-type scaffold proteins and provides the primary site for
[Fe

[36]
In yeast, two homologs exist
(Isu1 and Isu2)
[5,36,37]
with a high degree of sequence homol-
ogy compared to orthologs. Isu2 results from a recent gene
duplication and is found only in some fungi such as S. cerevi-

Iron is imported into the mitochondria through inner membrane proteins
Mrs3/4. Assembly of the Fe–S cluster occurs on the Isu1 scaffold. Cys-
teine is acted upon by the enzyme cysteine desulfurase (Nfs1) and acces-
sory protein (Isd11) for delivery of sulfur to Isu1. The metal has been
proposed to be delivered by the potential iron chaperone protein frataxin
(Yfh1). The reducing equivalents for the assembly reaction are provided
by ferredoxin reductase (Arh1) and ferredoxin (Yah1). Step 2: Release
of Fe–S clusters (red and yellow color circles) to apoproteins occurs by
interaction between Isu1 and Hsp70 chaperone Ssq1 in the presence of
Jac1, Mge1 and Grx5, followed by multiple additional protein interac-
tions.

siae; in the following description we will refer to the yeast
scaffold as only Isu1. The protein sequence identity of Isu1
is very close to the human orthologue (72%), at 80% for
the human to the Drosophila melanogaster (Dm) ortho-
logue, but 28% for human to the bacterial orthologue from
Thermotoga maritima (Tm). Isu orthologues are often but
not strictly stable as protein dimers; the active state of yeast
Isu1 is as a dimer.
[38]
Isu orthologues bind iron and sulfide
for use during cluster assembly.
[13,39]
Their assembly active
site is constructed of three conserved Cys residues
[40]
and a
fourth residue of varying identity; either a His, Asp, Ser, or
Lys have been proposed to complete the binding scheme.
[4]
In a highly related system, the assembly site in the Aquifex
aeolicus IscU is constructed of Cys
3
His coordination.
[41]
Isu1
contains the LPPVK motif required for interaction with
Ssq1.
[42]
Finally, the general structures of Isu are highly flexi-
ble and this flexibility is most likely important for both clus-
ter assembly and transfer.
[43]
The iron binding ability of the Isu orthologs are well
documented, although the molecular and mechanistic details
of this interaction are unclear. Previous reports indicate T.
maritima and H. sapien Isu bind a single ferrous iron atom
at micromolar binding affinities (2.7 and 2 mm respective-
ly).
[44,45]
Similar results have been obtained from our labora-
tory for the fly and yeast orthologues; however, both show
slightly tighter binding affinities in the nanomolar range.
[46]
Spectroscopic evidence indicates each Isu orthologue initial-
ly binds iron in an oxygen/nitrogen-based ligand environ-
ment lacking any sulfur ligation. Based on this, we believe
each Isu orthologue has an initial metal binding site distinct
from the Cys
3
X assembly site. Although the identity of this
initial binding site is unclear, a comparison of the electro-
static potential surface of Isu1 indicates the proteinC29s C-ter-
minal helix has a charge distribution that would accommo-
date ferrous iron binding.
[46]
Upon addition of sulfide to
yeast holo Isu orthologue, iron turns over during cluster for-
mation leading to partial Fe–(S) coordination with a Fe···Fe
vector of about 2.7 C138, consistent with our UV-Vis data sug-
gesting 2Fe–2S cluster formation.
[31]
In Isu1, the three conserved cysteine residues (Cys71,
Cys98, and Cys159) at the assembly site are all essential for
Fe–S cluster formation.
[11]
Site-directed mutagenesis studies,
comparisons of iron-to-protein ratios, and correlations of
cysteine content versus oligomeric state all confirm that one
Fe–S cluster coordinates to each Isu monomer in the func-
tional dimer.
[47,48]
Isu1 exists as a molten globular protein,
confirmed by 1,8-anilinonaphthalenesulfonate (ANS) fluo-
rescence measurements; however, this structure is dramati-
cally altered following cluster production.
[11,38,46]
Using the
crystal structure of IscU from Aquifex aeolicus with a [Fe
2
–
S
2
] cluster bound, one can develop a simulated model for
Isu1 with the solvent-exposed Fe–S cluster-binding site con-
taining the three conserved Cys residues and a semi con-
served histidine as ligands.
The Nfs1 cysteine desulfurase: This protein provides sulfur
required for Fe–S cluster biosynthesis.
[49]
Nfs1 is a pyridoxal
5’-phosphate (PLP)-dependent gamma-lyase enzyme with a
high degree of homology with other ISC cysteine desulfur-
ase orthologues (sequence identity of 64% for human, 67%
for fly, 37% for Tm).
[24]
Nfs1 catalyzes the degradation of
Cys as the substrate to the Ala product, liberating sulfur in
the process which then forms an internal persulfide bond
with a conserved internal Cys residue (Cys 421 in yeast and
Cys 324 in Thermotoga) on Nfs1 (Figure 2). Studies of the
orthologue NifS from A. vinelandii provide strong evidence
that sulfane sulfur (i.e., S
0
) in the persulfide bond is the acti-
vated form utilized for Fe–S cluster assembly.
[50]
Enzymatic
production of the sulfide for Fe–S cluster assembly requires
PLP, a derivative of vitamin B
6
that includes pyridoxamine
5’-phosphate and pyridoxine 5’-phosphate as cofactors. PLP
is covalently bound to the e-amino group of an internal con-
served lysine residue (Lys 299 in yeast and Lys 203 in The-
motoga), forming an internal aldimine.
[51,52]
There is shared
formation of an external aldimine when the a-amino group
of the substrate replaces the lysine. The activated form of
sulfur within the persulfide moiety can then easily be trans-
ferred to Isu1 to promote Fe–S cluster assembly.
Structural details regarding the Nfs1 active site have come
from studies from orthologues. Crystal structures of E. coli
IscS and the T. maritima NifS orthologs have both been
solved and both appeared as homodimers of a size about
45 kDa.
[51,52]
While the proteins share only a 40% sequence
identity, their overall fold is similar to what is expected for
members of the a-family of PLP enzymes. Both crystal
structures indicate a two-domain protein dimer, with one
domain harboring the pyridoxal phosphate binding site and
the second smaller domain containing the active-site cys-
Figure 2. Molecular details of the assembly complex. Apo Yfh1 binds two
ferrous iron atoms on the proteinC29s a-helix 1/b-strand 1 region and deliv-
ers the metal to the Isu1 scaffold through a beta-sheet interface. The ini-
tial iron-binding site on Isu1 is still unknown. The simulated Isu1 struc-
ture shows the Fe–S-cluster-binding site towards N-terminal region, con-
sisting of the 3 conserved cysteine residues. Nfs1 and Isd11, in presence
of PLP cofactor, catalyses the conversion of Cys to Ala resulting in the
formation of persulfide bound to Nfs1. Nfs1/Isd11 interacts with Isu1, in
the presence of Yah1 and Arh1, which releases sulfur for the formation
of Fe–S clusters.

CONCEPT
Iron–Sulfur Cluster Biosynthesis
teine believed to transiently carry the sulfur released from
cysteine as a persulfide adduct. In the T. maritima structure,
the twelve residues including the persulfide forming cysteine
(Cys324) are unfortunately located in a disordered region of
the structure.
[52]
However, this region is well resolved in the
E. coli structure and it shows this persulfide forming cys-
teine to be about 17 C138 from the enzymeC29s active site.
[51]
The
N-terminal b-strand in the bacterial protein, which is essen-
tial for activity, connects the two domains of the protein.
The Isd11 accessory protein: This protein is important for
cysteine desulfurase activity.
[13]
Interestingly, the mature
functional form of eukaryotic Nfs1 requires the presence of
the accessory protein Isd11 for activity. However, no bacte-
rial homolog of Isd11 has been found suggesting Isd11 is eu-
karyotic specific for Fe–S assembly. In vivo pulldown assays
indicate yeast Nfs1, of a molecular size of C2552 kDa, is asso-
ciated with Isd11 (11 kDa in size) and together they form a
complex of about C25200 kDa in size.
[22,23]
Nfs1 by itself is
prone to aggregation and degradation, however these traits
are generally abolished when Isd11 is present.
[53]
Although
the protein sequence of Isd11 is less conserved between eu-
karyotic orthologues, it is conserved from fungi to humans.
In vivo depletion of Isd11 greatly reduces the levels of aco-
nitase and Rieske containing proteins and absence signifi-
cantly impairs the catalyzed formation of iron–sulfur clusters
on Isu1.
[22]
The presence of Isd11 is required for in vivo ac-
tivity of Nfs1. While these results suggest Isd11 may control
the in vivo stability and function of Nfs1, additional results
suggest Isd11 may also mediate the intermolecular interac-
tion between Isu1, Nfs1, and frataxin.
[33,53]
Either way, Isd11
appears to play a functional role in mitochondrial Fe–S clus-
ter assembly in eukaryotes.
[54,55]
The Yfh1 frataxin protein: This protein is essential for cellu-
lar iron homeostasis and likely plays a direct role in Fe–S
cluster assembly.
[56,57]
While the exact function of frataxin is
unknown, it has been suggested to function in a variety of
capacities including as an iron chaperone for both heme and
Fe–S cluster pathways, as an iron storage protein in the mi-
tochondria, within the aconitase repair pathway, in energy
metabolism and recently as a gatekeeper in controlling NifS
activity.
[35]
Frataxin deficiency in humans is the cause of the
cardio-/neurodegenerative disorder FriedreichC29s ataxia
(FRDA), which affects about 1 in 50000 live births.
[58,59]
Phenotypes of the disorder include mitochondrial iron over-
load, breakdown in Fe–S cluster and heme biosynthesis, and
elevated reactive oxygen species levels likely due to the un-
regulated presence of high mitochondrial iron concentra-
tions.
[60,61]
To begin to understand the function of frataxin,
we will first explore the biophysical details of the molecule.
Structural and processing details indicate frataxin pre-
dominately functions as a soluble protein within the mito-
chondrial matrix.
[62]
In eukaryotes, frataxin is nuclear en-
coded but targeted to the mitochondria.
[63–65]
In vivo screens
indicate mature processed Yfh1 (minus the targeting se-
quence) is found predominately in the matrix.
[66]
Solution
and crystal structures have been reported for the yeast,
[67]
human,
[68,69]
and bacterial
[70]
frataxin orthologue monomers.
Frataxin has a unique fold that combines two terminal a-
helices, constructing one plane of the molecule, and five an-
tiparallel b-strands, that construct the second plane, placing
the protein in the a–b sandwich structural motif. A sixth
and sometimes seventh b-strand are found connecting the
two planes, giving a general shared frataxin topology of
a1b1b2b3b4b5b6(b7)a2 that is structurally conserved be-
tween eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
[56]
In Yfh1 and in all
other structurally characterized frataxin orthologues, numer-
ous solvent exposed acidic residues line the a1 and b1 pro-
tein region, forming a contiguous anionic surface ideally
suited for iron binding.
All frataxin orthologs bind iron, suggesting a direct role
in cellular iron regulation and utilization. The iron binding
activity of Yfh1 was first recorded for the frataxin ortho-
logs.
[71]
When exposed to high iron concentrations at low
salt in an environment uncontrolled for oxygen, Yfh1 assem-
bles in a step-wise fashion to form 24-mer spherical aggre-
gates that loosely resemble the iron storage protein ferri-
tin.
[72]
While Yfh1 aggregation may be important under iron
stressed conditions, the monomeric form of frataxin is the
functional form during normal mitochondrial Fe–S cluster
assembly.
[33]
Metal to protein stoichiometries, measured for
monomeric bacterial
[73]

[71]
, fly,
[31]
and human fratax-
in

, show these proteins will tightly bind two, two, one,
and up to six Fe
II
atoms, respectively. Iron dissociation con-
stants, measured for bacterial (CyaY), yeast (Yfh1), fly
(Dfh), and human frataxin (HsFtx) give averaged K
D
values
of about 4, 3, 6 and 12–55 mm, respectively. NMR studies
have implicated the conserved Asp, Glu, and His residues in
the proteinC29s a-helix 1 and b-strand 1 as being involved in
iron binding (Figure 3).
[67,71]
Structural studies show frataxin
binds Fe

in a high-spin, symmetric, six-coordinate ligand
environment constructed exclusively by oxygen and nitrogen
based ligands, in good agreement with a-helix 1 and b-
strand 1 Asp, His, and Glu residues identified as interacting
with iron in the NMR titrations.

Interaction between Assembly Protein Partners
Cofactor assembly is believed to proceed through formation
of a macromolecular complex involving Nfs1, Isd11, Isu1,
and Yfh1. Complex formation between protein partners en-
sures cluster assembly and delivery proceeds in a controlled
manner. Regarding the Yfh1/Isu1 interaction, NMR chemi-
cal shift mapping studies implicate frataxinC29s b-sheet surface
as the binding region onto Isu1.
[46]
Molecular details ob-
tained from studying the Yfh1/Isu1 interaction indicate key
residues on frataxinC29s b-sheet surface (N122, K123, Q124,
W131) are important in forming the intermolecular interface
with the scaffold protein.
[78]
In most cases, frataxin and Isu
protein binding was iron dependent.
[30]
Although additional
details of how all the yeast proteins interact are not yet
clear, insight can be gained from looking at studies of ortho-
logs. A recent crystallographic study of the bacterial system
provides structural insight into how cysteine desulfurase
(IscS) and the scaffold (IscU) interact.
[79]
The IscS/IscU
complex structure suggests IscU interacts with the C-termi-
nus of the cysteine desulfurase near the IscS active site cys-
teine (Cys328). The three conserved cysteines of the IscU
active site project towards the IscS Cys328 containing loop.
In vivo binding analysis places the bacterial frataxin binding
interface on IscS in close proximity to the IscS/U binding
surface.
[79]
NMR mapping studies of CyaY binding to IscS
implicate the conserved residues in the frataxin helix-1/
strand 1 ridge as interacting with the cysteine desulfurase.
[35]
By simulating the structures of Isu1 and Nfs1, based on
the structures of the bacterial orthologs, we have been able
to propose a structural model for how the yeast proteins in-
teract with frataxin.
[46]
In our model, Yfh1 could interact
with both Isu1 (using frataxinC29s b-sheet surface) and Nfs1
(using frataxinC29s a1–b1 ridge) with minor closing of Nfs1
dimer exposed gap, placing both frataxin and the cysteine
desulfurase in position to donate substrates to Isu1 for clus-
ter assembly. However, the positioning, the stoichiometry,
and the function of Isd11 are still poorly defined. As stated
previously, in eukaryotes Nfs1 requires a small accessory
subunit Isd11.
[22]
Isd11 has been proposed to stabilize Nfs1
through a direct interaction.
[23]
For the formation of the Fe–
S cluster on Isu1/2, sulfur is provided by a direct interaction
with the Nfs1/Isd11 complex.
[32,40,80]
A large number of the
molecular details for this interaction have come from exten-
sive studies of the bacterial cluster assembly pathways. The
mechanism of sulfur transfer between cysteine desulfurase
and the scaffold is unclear. Two hypothesis have been pro-
posed: either transfer could occur through the formation of
a heterodisulfide-bridged intermediate between Nfs1 and
Isu1
[81]
or through a transpersulfuration reaction similar to
that observed in the bacterial SUF system.
[12]
The sulfur
transfer in the SUF system involves a conserved cysteine on
the sulfur transfer protein (SufE), which binds to the sulfur
released from the cysteine desulfurase (SufS) to form an in-
termediate persulfide bond before it is transferred to the
corresponding scaffold protein. In this process SufE stimu-
lates the activity of SufS.
[82,83]
Isd11 in yeast resembles SufE
in some respects, but it is unlikely to function as a sulfur
transfer protein because it completely lacks cysteine amino
acids in its polypeptide backbone.
Although the exact role of frataxin in Fe–S cluster assem-
bly is still not clear, this protein interacts with the scaffold
protein, the cysteine desulfurase and with Isd11, either indi-
vidually and within a multiprotein complex, suggesting it is
a key player in regulating the pathway.
[32,33]
The binding in-
teraction between holo Yfh1 and apo Isu1 has been shown
to be submicromolar affinity (166 nm).
[46]
This binding affini-
ty is tighter than iron binding affinity of frataxin suggesting
the interaction is thermodynamically favorable for metal de-
livery if frataxin is the chaperone in the pathway. Further,
co-purification studies from pulldown assays indicate Yfh1
forms a stable complex with Isu1/Nfs1.
[32,33,84]
Binding be-
tween Yfh1 and Isu1/Nfs1 was significantly higher when
physiological concentrations of ferrous iron were maintained
during complex isolation.
[30,32]
Mechanistic details of the fra-
taxin/cysteine desulfurase interaction are, however, lacking.
In the bacterial system, frataxin regulates the cysteine desul-
furase in an iron dependent manner and evidence suggests,
at high iron-to-protein ratios, frataxin perturbs the activity
of the cysteine desulfurase and formation of the Fe–S clus-
ter, suggesting frataxin acts as a negative regulator of the
cysteine desulfurase.
[35]
In contrast, recent results with ortho-
logues indicate frataxin positively regulates the K
m
for cys-
teine desulfurase substrate binding, suggesting frataxin is
acting as an allosteric activator for the enzyme.
[85]
The role
of the frataxin/Isd11 interaction is also still unclear. Frataxin
has been shown to interact with Isd11 using co-immunopre-
cipitation and mass spectrometry in mammalian cells.
[84]
However, this interaction of human frataxin and the human
Isd11 orthologue (ISD11) decreases under clinical point mu-
tations I154F and W155R, which can be restored through
nickel supplementation.
[84]
Given the degree of binding over-
lap between each protein partners, it is reasonable to sug-
gest in vivo cluster assembly occurs through the formation
of a complex core constructed of all protein partners.
Summary and Outlook
Iron–sulfur containing proteins are found ubiquitously in
the body and they participate in many fundamental bio-
chemical tasks in nearly every living cell. The mitochondrial
ISC pathway supplies clusters for proteins within the mito-
chondria, and also plays a role in cluster incorporation in
the cytosol and throughout the cell.
[3]
Due to their wide-
spread usage in many fundamental biochemical pathways, it
is no wonder that humans, with a deficiency in the produc-
tion of any of the protein partners responsible for cluster as-
sembly, have serious disorders often incompatible with life.
[5]
FriedreichC29s ataxia, a deficiency in production of functional
frataxin, is just one such disorder. Despite the importance of
this pathway, we are just now beginning to understand the
molecular events that lead to mitochondrial Fe–S cluster as-
sembly. Future studies directed at understanding the path-

Iron–Sulfur Cluster Biosynthesis
way at a molecular level will surely need to focus on the
structural aspects of how the protein partners interact and
the biophysical characterization of key molecular elements
that drive these interactions. A glimpse of these structural
details has recently been supplied in the bacterial system.
[86]
Once these details are provided, a mechanistic understand-
ing of how these protein partners produce Fe–S clusters will
surely follow.
